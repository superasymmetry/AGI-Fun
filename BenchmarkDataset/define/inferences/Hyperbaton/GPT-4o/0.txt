A hyperbaton is a rhetorical device involving the deliberate rearrangement of the usual word order in a sentence to create emphasis or a particular effect. This technique is often used in poetry and prose to highlight a specific point or to maintain a particular rhythm or rhyme. By placing words or phrases in non-standard positions, a hyperbaton draws attention to the rearranged elements, thereby enhancing the expressive power of the language. An example of hyperbaton might be saying "Sweet, she is," instead of "She is sweet."
