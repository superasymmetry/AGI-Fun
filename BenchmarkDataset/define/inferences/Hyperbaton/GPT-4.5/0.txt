A hyperbaton is a rhetorical device in which the normal order of words is altered for emphasis or poetic effect. This figure of speech involves transposing words in a sentence to create a distinctive impact or to maintain a specific meter or rhyme in poetry. By placing words in unexpected positions, writers can draw attention to particular elements of the sentence or create a more memorable or artistic expression. Hyperbaton is often used in literature and oratory to evoke curiosity, highlight specific ideas, or add an element of surprise. It has been employed by many famous writers and poets, such as William Shakespeare and John Milton, to enhance the poetic and expressive quality of their language.
