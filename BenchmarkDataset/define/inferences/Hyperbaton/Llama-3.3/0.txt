A hyperbaton is a figure of speech in which the normal word order of a sentence or phrase is intentionally altered for emphasis, effect, or rhythm. This can involve changing the position of words, phrases, or clauses to create a sense of surprise, add emphasis, or convey a particular tone.

In a hyperbaton, the usual subject-verb-object (SVO) word order is disrupted, often by placing an adjective, adverb, or other modifier in an unusual position. This can create a sense of drama, tension, or excitement, and can be used to add emphasis to a particular word or idea.

Hyperbaton is commonly used in poetry, literature, and rhetoric to create a sense of style, add variety to sentence structure, and engage the reader or listener. It can also be used to convey complex ideas or emotions in a way that is more expressive and memorable than standard word order.

Examples of hyperbaton include:

* "Up the hill ran the child" (instead of "The child ran up the hill")
* "Down the street walked the man" (instead of "The man walked down the street")
* "With great enthusiasm, the crowd cheered" (instead of "The crowd cheered with great enthusiasm")

Hyperbaton is often used in combination with other literary devices, such as metaphor, simile, and alliteration, to create a rich and expressive language.
