A hyperbaton is a rhetorical device that involves the rearrangement of the normal order of words in a sentence for emphasis, rhythm, or stylistic effect. It is often used to create a distinctive or dramatic impact, allowing writers and speakers to focus the listenerâ€™s attention on particular words or ideas. In literature, poetry, and speech, hyperbaton can add emphasis, convey emotion, or enhance the aesthetic quality of the language. For example, instead of saying "I can't go out," a hyperbaton might be "Out I can't go." Writers like Shakespeare and other poets have employed hyperbaton to achieve such effects in their work.
