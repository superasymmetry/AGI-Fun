 Hyperbaton is a figure of speech in which the normal order of words in a sentence is altered for emphasis, effect, or stylistic reasons. In hyperbaton, the usual word order is inverted, and the sentence structure becomes unconventional. For example, instead of saying "The cat sat on the mat," you might say "On the mat, the cat sat" to emphasize the location. Hyperbaton is often used in poetry and rhetoric to create a more poetic or dramatic effect.
