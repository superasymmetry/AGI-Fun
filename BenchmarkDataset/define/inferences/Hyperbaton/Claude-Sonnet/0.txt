A hyperbaton is a rhetorical device or figure of speech in which the normal or logical order of words in a sentence is changed or inverted for emphasis or poetic effect. It involves the separation of words that normally belong together or the placement of words in an unusual order. This technique is often used in poetry and literature to create dramatic effect, add emphasis, or achieve a particular rhythm.

For example:
- Normal order: "She picked the red flower"
- Hyperbaton: "The flower, red, she picked"

A famous example comes from Yoda in Star Wars: "Powerful you have become, the dark side I sense in you."

This device was particularly common in Latin literature, as Latin's flexible word order made it easier to construct such phrases while maintaining grammatical clarity.
