A **hyperbaton** is a figure of speech in which the typical or expected word order of a sentence is deliberately rearranged for emphasis, poetic effect, or rhetorical impact. By altering the natural syntax, a hyperbaton draws attention to certain words or ideas, making the phrase more memorable or dramatic.

### Examples of Hyperbaton:
1. **"This I must see."** (Instead of "I must see this.")  
2. **"Into the valley of death rode the six hundred."** (Alfred, Lord Tennyson, *The Charge of the Light Brigade*)  
   *(Normal order: "The six hundred rode into the valley of death.")*  
3. **"Object there was none. Passion there was none."** (Edgar Allan Poe, *The Tell-Tale Heart*)  

### Types of Hyperbaton:
- **Anastrophe**: A specific type of hyperbaton involving the inversion of normal word order (e.g., *"Yoda speaks like this"* → *"Like this, Yoda speaks"*).  
- **Parenthesis**: Inserting a word or phrase disruptively into a sentence (e.g., *"The man—his hat was crooked—walked away"*).  

### Purpose:
- Creates emphasis or surprise.  
- Enhances poetic or lyrical quality.  
- Mimics archaic or elevated speech (common in religious texts and classical literature).
