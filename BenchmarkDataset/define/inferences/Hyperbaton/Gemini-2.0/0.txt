Hyperbaton is a figure of speech in which the typical, expected order of words is deliberately altered for emphasis or artistic effect. It's essentially a fancy way of saying that someone is deliberately messing with the sentence structure.

Here's a breakdown:

*   **What it does:** It rearranges the words in a sentence.
*   **Why it's used:**

    *   **Emphasis:** It can highlight a specific word or phrase by placing it in an unusual position.
    *   **Poetry and Rhythm:** It can create a more musical or poetic flow.
    *   **Archaic or Formal Tone:** It can evoke a sense of the past or a more formal style of speaking.
    *   **Suspense:** It can build suspense by delaying the most important part of the sentence.
*   **Examples:**

    *   **"Object there was none. Passion there was none."** (Normal order: "There was no object. There was no passion.") - Used for emphasis and a somewhat dramatic effect.
    *   **"Some rise by sin, and some by virtue fall."** (Normal order: "Some rise by sin, and some fall by virtue.") - Used for symmetry and poetic rhythm.
    *   **"This I must see."** (Normal order: "I must see this.") - Creates a more formal or emphatic tone.
    *   **"She looked at the sky, dark and menacing."** (Normal order: "She looked at the dark and menacing sky.") - Used to emphasize the dark and menacing nature of the sky.

**Key things to remember:**

*   It's not just any grammatical error. Hyperbaton is intentional.
*   The altered word order should still be understandable, even if it's not the most natural way to say it.
*   It's often found in older literature, poetry, and formal speeches.

Think of it as a deliberate stylistic choice to make the language more interesting, impactful, or evocative.
