A hyperbaton is a rhetorical device or figure of speech in which the natural order of words in a sentence is rearranged to create an effect or to emphasize a particular word or phrase. This technique often involves moving an adjective after the noun it modifies or placing an important word at the end of a sentence. Hyperbaton is used for stylistic purposes to draw attention, create intrigue, or achieve a particular rhythm or emphasis in a passage. It has been used throughout literature, from classical works to modern poetry and prose. An example of hyperbaton is the phrase "this I must see," instead of the more usual order, "I must see this."
