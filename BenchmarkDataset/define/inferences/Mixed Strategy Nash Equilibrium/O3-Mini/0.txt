In game theory, a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium is a situation where each player in a game randomizes over different possible strategies, with specific probabilities assigned to each strategy, in such a way that no player can unilaterally change their own strategy to achieve a better expected payoff. This is in contrast to a pure strategy Nash equilibrium, where players select a single strategy with certainty.

In a mixed strategy, players choose among available strategies according to a probability distribution, making their actions unpredictable. This approach is particularly useful in games where no pure strategy Nash equilibrium exists or where players can potentially benefit from being unpredictable.

To be in a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium, each player's mixed strategy should be optimal given the mixed strategies of other players. This means that the expected payoff from choosing a mixed strategy is maximized, assuming other players maintain their strategy. Therefore, in a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium, all players are playing strategies that are a best response to the strategies played by others.

For example, in the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game, if two players each randomly choose Rock, Paper, or Scissors with equal probability (1/3 each), then neither player can improve their payoff by changing their strategy, given the strategy of the other, which constitutes a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium.
