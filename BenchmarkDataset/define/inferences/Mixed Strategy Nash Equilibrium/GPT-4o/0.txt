In game theory, a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium is a situation where each player in a game chooses a probability distribution over their available actions (or strategies) such that no player can improve their expected payoff by unilaterally changing their probability distribution, given the strategies of the other players. This concept extends the idea of Nash equilibrium from pure strategies, where players choose a single action with certainty, to situations where players randomize over multiple possible actions.

In a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium, each player is indifferent among the actions they are randomizing over, based on the expected payoffs. This implies that a player is receiving the same expected payoff for each strategy they are playing with positive probability, given the strategies of the opponents.

The introduction of mixed strategies is particularly useful in games where no pure strategy Nash equilibrium exists, or in games where players can potentially benefit from being unpredictable. The equilibrium can be found by solving for the probability distributions that satisfy the condition that players cannot gain by deviating from their mixed strategy, given the opponents' strategies.
