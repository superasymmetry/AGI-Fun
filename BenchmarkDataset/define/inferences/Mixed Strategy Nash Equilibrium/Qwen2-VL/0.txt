In game theory, a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium is a situation in which each player in a game chooses a probability distribution over their possible actions, such that no player can benefit by changing their strategy, given the strategies of the other players. In other words, each player's strategy is optimal against the strategies of the other players.
A mixed strategy Nash equilibrium is different from a pure strategy Nash equilibrium, in which each player chooses a single action that is optimal against the actions of the other players. In a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium, each player randomizes over their possible actions according to a probability distribution, and no player can improve their expected payoff by deviating from their chosen strategy.
Mixed strategy Nash equilibria are often used to model situations in which players are uncertain about the actions of the other players, or in which players have multiple actions that are equally good. For example, in the game of rock-paper-scissors, each player has three possible actions (rock, paper, or scissors), and there is no single action that is always the best choice. In this case, a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium would involve each player choosing each action with equal probability, so that no player can benefit by deviating from this strategy.
