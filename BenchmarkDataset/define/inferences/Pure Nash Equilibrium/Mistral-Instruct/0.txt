 A pure Nash equilibrium is a situation in a game theory where no player has an incentive to unilaterally deviate from their current strategy, given that all other players stick to their current strategies as well.

In other words, in a game with multiple players, each player's strategy is a best response to the strategies of all other players. If each player is choosing their strategy based on this principle, then the combination of strategies chosen is a pure Nash equilibrium.

For example, consider a game where two players, Alice and Bob, can either cooperate (C) or defect (D). The payoff matrix could look like this:

|       | Alice C | Alice D |
|-------|---------|---------|
| Bob C | 3, 3     | 0, 5    |
| Bob D | 5, 0    | 1, 1    |

In this game, if Alice chooses to cooperate (C), Bob's best response is also to cooperate (3 > 1). Similarly, if Alice chooses to defect (D), Bob's best response is also to defect (5 > 0). Therefore, both (C, C) and (D, D) are pure Nash equilibria.

However, in this specific example, (C, C) is a more stable equilibrium because both players are better off cooperating compared to defecting. This is known as a Pareto optimal equilibrium.
