In game theory, a pure Nash equilibrium is a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve their outcome by unilaterally changing their strategy, assuming that the other players' strategies remain unchanged. In other words, a pure Nash equilibrium is a stable state of a game in which no player has an incentive to deviate from their chosen strategy, given the strategies chosen by the other players.
