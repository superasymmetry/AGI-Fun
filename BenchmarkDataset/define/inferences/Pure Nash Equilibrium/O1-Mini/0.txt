In game theory, a pure Nash equilibrium is a concept used to describe a stable state in a strategic game where each player has chosen a strategy, and no player can benefit by unilaterally changing their strategy while the other players' strategies remain unchanged. In other words, given the strategies selected by the other players, no individual player has an incentive to deviate from their current choice, as doing so would not result in a better payoff for them.

In a formal sense, consider a strategic game with several players, where each player has a set of strategies available to them. A pure Nash equilibrium is a tuple of strategies (one for each player) such that each player's strategy is a best response to the strategies chosen by the others. In other words, the strategy profile reaches equilibrium when every playerâ€™s strategy is optimal given the strategies of the other players.

This concept is important because it provides a way of predicting how rational, self-interested players will behave in strategic settings, assuming they want to maximize their own payoffs and have knowledge of the strategies employed by others. Note that not all games have a pure Nash equilibrium; some games may have no equilibrium in pure strategies, while others might have multiple equilibria.
