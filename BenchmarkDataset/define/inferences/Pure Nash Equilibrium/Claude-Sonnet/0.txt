A pure Nash equilibrium is a situation in game theory where each player is using a pure strategy (not a probabilistic mix of strategies) and no player can benefit by unilaterally changing their strategy while other players keep theirs unchanged. In other words, each player's strategy is the best response to the other players' strategies. At a pure Nash equilibrium, every player is playing their optimal strategy given what the other players are doing.

For example, in the classic "Prisoner's Dilemma," both prisoners confessing is a pure Nash equilibrium because neither prisoner can improve their outcome by changing their strategy while the other's strategy remains fixed.
