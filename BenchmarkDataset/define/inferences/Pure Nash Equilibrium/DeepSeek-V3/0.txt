In game theory, a **pure Nash equilibrium** (pure NE) is a set of strategies, one for each player in a game, where no player can benefit by unilaterally changing their strategy while the other players keep theirs unchanged. 

### Formal Definition:
Consider a game with \( n \) players, where each player \( i \) has a strategy set \( S_i \). A strategy profile \( s^* = (s_1^*, s_2^*, \ldots, s_n^*) \) is a **pure Nash equilibrium** if for every player \( i \), the following holds:

\[
u_i(s_i^*, s_{-i}^*) \geq u_i(s_i, s_{-i}^*) \quad \text{for all } s_i \in S_i
\]

Here:
- \( u_i \) is the payoff function for player \( i \),
- \( s_{-i}^* \) represents the strategies of all players except \( i \),
- \( s_i^* \) is the strategy of player \( i \) in the equilibrium,
- \( s_i \) is any alternative strategy for player \( i \).

### Intuition:
- At a pure Nash equilibrium, no player has an incentive to deviate from their chosen strategy because doing so would not improve their payoff, given what the other players are doing.
- The equilibrium is "pure" because each player chooses a single deterministic strategy (as opposed to a mixed strategy, where players randomize over multiple strategies).

### Example: Prisoner's Dilemma
Consider the classic Prisoner's Dilemma with two players, each having two strategies: **Cooperate (C)** or **Defect (D)**. The payoff matrix is:

|               | Player 2: C | Player 2: D |
|---------------|------------|------------|
| **Player 1: C** | (-1, -1)   | (-3, 0)    |
| **Player 1: D** | (0, -3)    | (-2, -2)   |

The pure Nash equilibrium here is **(D, D)**, because:
- If Player 1 unilaterally switches from D to C, their payoff goes from -2 to -3 (worse).
- If Player 2 unilaterally switches from D to C, their payoff goes from -2 to -3 (worse).
Thus, neither player can improve their outcome by changing their strategy alone.

### Key Points:
1. **No unilateral deviation**: No player can gain by changing their strategy while others stay fixed.
2. **Not necessarily optimal**: A pure Nash equilibrium does not always lead to the best collective outcome (e.g., in the Prisoner's Dilemma, mutual cooperation would be better but is not an equilibrium).
3. **Existence**: Not all games have a pure Nash equilibrium (e.g., Rock-Paper-Scissors has none in pure strategies but does in mixed strategies).

Pure Nash equilibria are foundational in game theory and are used to analyze strategic interactions in economics, political science, biology, and more.
