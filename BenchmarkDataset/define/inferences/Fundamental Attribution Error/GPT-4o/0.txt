The fundamental attribution error is a cognitive bias that involves over-emphasizing personal characteristics and under-emphasizing situational factors when explaining other people's behavior. In other words, when someone else does something, particularly something negative, people tend to attribute it to their personality or disposition rather than considering the external circumstances that might have influenced their actions. For example, if someone cuts you off in traffic, you might conclude that they are a rude or reckless person, rather than considering they might be rushing due to an emergency. This contrasts with how people often attribute their own behavior to situational factors.
