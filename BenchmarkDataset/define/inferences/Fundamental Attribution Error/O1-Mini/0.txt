The fundamental attribution error is a common psychological bias where people tend to overemphasize personality-based explanations for others' behaviors while underestimating the influence of situational factors. In other words, when evaluating someone else's actions, individuals are likely to attribute those actions to the person's inherent character or disposition rather than considering the external circumstances that may have influenced their behavior. For example, if someone cuts you off in traffic, you might think they are a rude or aggressive person (dispositional attribution) rather than considering they might have an emergency or are simply in a hurry due to an external situation (situational attribution). This bias highlights the tendency for humans to misjudge others' motivations while failing to recognize the complexities of situational influences.
