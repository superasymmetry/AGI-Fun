The fundamental attribution error (FAE), also known as correspondence bias or attribution effect, is a cognitive bias where people tend to overemphasize personal characteristics and ignore situational factors when explaining someone else's behavior. Here's a detailed explanation:

Key aspects:

1. Core concept:
- Attributing others' behavior primarily to their personality
- Underestimating the influence of external circumstances

2. Examples:
- Assuming someone is rude because of their personality rather than considering they might be having a bad day
- Judging a person's driving skills based on one observed mistake
- Labeling someone as lazy without considering their circumstances

3. Cultural differences:
- More prevalent in individualistic cultures
- Less common in collectivist societies that emphasize context

4. Impact:
- Can lead to unfair judgments
- May affect relationships and social interactions
- Can influence workplace dynamics

5. How to avoid it:
- Consider situational factors
- Practice empathy
- Gather more context before making judgments
- Be aware of the bias

The fundamental attribution error is important to understand because it affects how we perceive and judge others in daily life.
