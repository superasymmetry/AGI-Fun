The fundamental attribution error is a psychological bias where people tend to overemphasize personality-based explanations for the behavior of others while underestimating the influence of situational factors. This bias leads individuals to attribute others' actions to their character or disposition rather than considering the external circumstances that might have influenced their behavior. For example, if someone cuts us off in traffic, we might quickly label them as a rude or inconsiderate person, rather than considering that they might be rushing due to an emergency. This tendency can affect our judgment and interactions with others by creating misunderstandings and reinforcing stereotypes.
