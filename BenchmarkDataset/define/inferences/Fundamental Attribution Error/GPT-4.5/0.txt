The fundamental attribution error is a common psychological bias that refers to the tendency for people to overemphasize personal characteristics and underestimate situational factors when explaining someone else's behavior. For example, if a person sees someone else acting rudely, they might attribute this behavior to the person's inherent personality (e.g., "They are a rude person") rather than considering external circumstances that might have influenced the behavior (e.g., "They might be having a bad day"). This error highlights the inclination to see others' actions as a reflection of their character while underappreciating the role of situational pressures.
