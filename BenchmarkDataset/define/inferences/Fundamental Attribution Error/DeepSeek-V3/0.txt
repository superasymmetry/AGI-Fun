The **fundamental attribution error (FAE)**, also known as the **correspondence bias**, is a cognitive bias in social psychology where people tend to overemphasize **dispositional (internal) explanations** for others' behavior while underestimating **situational (external) factors**.  

### **Key Aspects of the Fundamental Attribution Error:**  
1. **Overestimating Personality Traits** – When observing someone else's actions, we often attribute their behavior to their character, personality, or intentions (e.g., "They're rude because they're a bad person").  
2. **Underestimating Situational Influences** – We tend to ignore external factors that may have influenced their behavior (e.g., "They snapped at me because they're under stress, not because they're mean").  

### **Example:**  
- If a driver cuts you off in traffic, you might assume they’re a reckless or selfish person (dispositional attribution), rather than considering they might be rushing to an emergency (situational attribution).  

### **Why Does It Happen?**  
- **Cognitive Ease:** It’s mentally easier to blame personality than analyze complex situations.  
- **Perspective Difference:** When judging ourselves, we see situational factors ("I was late because of traffic"), but when judging others, we focus on their traits ("They’re always late because they’re irresponsible").  

### **Exceptions:**  
- The FAE is more common in **Western individualistic cultures** than in **collectivist cultures**, where situational factors are often given more weight.  

This bias can lead to misunderstandings, conflicts, and unfair judgments in social interactions. Recognizing it helps in developing more balanced and empathetic perspectives.
