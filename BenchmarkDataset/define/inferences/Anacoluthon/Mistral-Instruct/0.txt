 An anacoluthon is a figure of speech in which a sentence begins with one grammatical construction but then changes to another mid-sentence, creating a grammatically awkward or incomplete sentence. This can be used for stylistic effect, such as to create a sense of confusion, uncertainty, or to convey a sudden change in thought. For example, "I came, because I thought, it would be a good idea." Here, the sentence starts with a subordinate clause ("I came, because") but then switches to a main clause ("it would be a good idea") without a proper connection, creating an anacoluthon.
