An anacoluthon is a literary or rhetorical device that involves a sudden break in the structure of a sentence, leading to an unexpected grammatical shift. This can result in a sentence that seems disjointed or incomplete, and often reflects a speaker's changing thoughts or emotions. Anacoluthon can be used for dramatic effect or to convey the unpredictability of speech and thought. One common use of anacoluthon is to capture the natural flow of conversation or the speaker's stream of consciousness.
