An anacoluthon is a literary device that involves a sudden break or interruption in the grammatical flow of a sentence. This results in a shift to an unexpected sequence or construction, which can create a sense of surprise, emphasize a point, or reflect natural speech patterns. Anacoluthon is often used in literature and rhetoric to convey a character's thought process or emotional state more authentically, capturing the disorganized way that people sometimes speak or think. For example, a speaker might begin a sentence with one structure but switch midway to another, reflecting a change in thought or intention.
