An **anacoluthon** (pronounced *an-uh-kuh-LOO-thon*) is a rhetorical device in which a sentence or clause abruptly shifts grammatical structure, creating an inconsistency or break in syntax. This intentional disruption can reflect natural speech patterns, emotional emphasis, or a character’s fragmented thought process.

### Key Features:
1. **Grammatical Shift**: The sentence starts with one structure but ends with another, often leaving the initial thought incomplete.
2. **Purpose**: Used to mimic spontaneity, confusion, excitement, or dramatic effect in writing or speech.
3. **Common in Dialogue**: Frequently appears in informal speech, stream-of-consciousness writing, or persuasive rhetoric.

### Examples:
- **"You really ought—well, do what you like!"**  
  (The speaker starts with a directive but abandons it mid-sentence.)
- **"If I had known—but why dwell on the past?"**  
  (The "if" clause is left unresolved, shifting to a rhetorical question.)
- **Homer’s *Odyssey***: "Then he—I can’t describe how he moved—like a god!"  
  (A narrative interruption for emphasis.)

### Why Use It?
- **Realism**: Captures the unpredictability of spoken language.
- **Emotional Impact**: Highlights agitation, distraction, or urgency.
- **Stylistic Choice**: Writers like James Joyce or William Faulkner use it to depict complex psyches.

### Contrast With:
- **Anacolutha** (plural) are intentional, whereas **grammatical errors** are unintentional mistakes.
- Similar devices: **aposiopesis** (breaking off mid-sentence) or **ellipsis** (omitting words).
