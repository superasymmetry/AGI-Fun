An analogy is a comparison between two things that are otherwise dissimilar, made to highlight a particular similarity. This literary device helps clarify or explain an idea by relating it to something more familiar to the audience. Analogies are often used in writing and speech to simplify complex concepts, make arguments more persuasive, or to add vivid imagery. For example, saying "the structure of an atom is like a solar system" is an analogy that compares the atom's nucleus and orbiting electrons to the sun and planets, respectively.
