An analogy is a comparison between two things that are otherwise dissimilar, used to highlight a similarity in a specific aspect. It is often employed to clarify or explain a concept by relating it to something more familiar to the audience. Analogies can be simple comparisons or extended similarities, and they are frequently used in literature, education, and everyday communication. For example, saying "the human brain is like a computer" is an analogy that helps explain how the brain processes and stores information.
