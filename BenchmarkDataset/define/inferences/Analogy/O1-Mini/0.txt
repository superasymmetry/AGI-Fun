An analogy is a comparison between two things that are otherwise unlike, typically for the purpose of explanation or clarification. It highlights similarities between the two to help illustrate a point or make a concept easier to understand. Analogies are often used in literature, education, and everyday communication. For example, the analogy "Just as a caterpillar transforms into a butterfly, a student matures through education" compares the process of metamorphosis in caterpillars to the personal growth experienced by students through learning.
