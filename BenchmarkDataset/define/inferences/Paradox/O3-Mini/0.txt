A paradox is a statement, proposition, or situation that contradicts itself or appears to defy logic and intuition, often leading to a conclusion that seems logically unacceptable or self-contradictory. Paradoxes can arise in various contexts, such as language, math, philosophy, and more, and they are often used to challenge established norms, provoke thought, or illustrate the complexities of reasoning and perception.

For example, a famous paradox is the "liar paradox," which involves a sentence like "This statement is false." If the statement is true, then it must be false, as it claims, but if it is false, then it is actually true, creating a contradiction. Paradoxes like this highlight the limitations and potential inconsistencies within our understanding of language and truth.
