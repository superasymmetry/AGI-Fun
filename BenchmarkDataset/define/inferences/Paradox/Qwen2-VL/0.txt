A paradox is a statement, situation, or phenomenon that appears to be contradictory or absurd, but upon closer examination, may reveal a deeper truth or insight. Paradoxes often challenge our assumptions and force us to think more deeply about a particular concept or idea. They can be found in many areas of life, including philosophy, mathematics, science, and literature. Some well-known examples of paradoxes include the liar paradox, the paradox of the heap, and the paradox of Zeno's arrow.
