A **paradox** is a statement, situation, or concept that appears to be self-contradictory or logically absurd, yet may reveal a deeper truth upon closer examination. Paradoxes often challenge intuition and conventional reasoning, highlighting inconsistencies or limitations in language, logic, or perception.

### Key Features of a Paradox:
1. **Apparent Contradiction** – The statement seems impossible or illogical at first glance (e.g., "This statement is false").
2. **Hidden Insight** – Some paradoxes expose flaws in reasoning, assumptions, or systems (e.g., Zeno's paradoxes questioning motion).
3. **Types of Paradoxes**:
   - **Logical Paradoxes**: Self-referential contradictions (e.g., the **Liar Paradox**: "I am lying").
   - **Semantic Paradoxes**: Arise from ambiguous language (e.g., the **Barber Paradox**: "The barber shaves all who do not shave themselves").
   - **Philosophical Paradoxes**: Challenge ideas of reality or ethics (e.g., the **Ship of Theseus** questioning identity over time).
   - **Mathematical Paradoxes**: Reveal inconsistencies in formal systems (e.g., **Russell's Paradox** in set theory).

### Examples:
- **Grandfather Paradox**: "If you travel back in time and kill your grandfather, you would never be born—so how could you kill him?"
- **Olbers' Paradox**: "If the universe is infinite and static, why is the night sky dark?"
- **Paradox of Choice**: "More options can lead to less satisfaction."

### Purpose:
Paradoxes often serve as tools for critical thinking, pushing boundaries in philosophy, science, and mathematics. They reveal gaps in understanding and inspire new theories (e.g., quantum mechanics resolving wave-particle duality).
