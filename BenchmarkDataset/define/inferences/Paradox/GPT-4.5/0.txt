A paradox is a statement or situation that, despite apparently valid reasoning from true premises, leads to a conclusion that seems logically unacceptable or self-contradictory. Paradoxes often reveal underlying complexities, ambiguities, or misunderstandings in concepts or assumptions. They can be used to stimulate thought, illustrate logical challenges, and explore philosophical questions. Some well-known examples include:

1. **Liar Paradox**: The statement "This sentence is false" creates a paradox because if it is true, then it must be false, but if it is false, it must be true.

2. **Paradox of the Unexpected Hanging**: A judge tells a condemned prisoner that he will be hanged at noon on one weekday in the following week but that the execution will be a surprise to the prisoner. The prisoner deduces that he will never be hanged, leading to a paradox when he is surprised when actually hanged.

3. **Zeno's Paradoxes**: These are a set of philosophical problems that question the nature of motion and divisibility, such as the paradox of Achilles and the tortoise, where Achilles can never catch the tortoise ahead of him if he must first reach the point where the tortoise began.

Paradoxes can be logical, semantic, mathematical, or literary, each serving different roles in challenging our understanding and encouraging deeper analysis.
