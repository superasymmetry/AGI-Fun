A paradox is a statement or concept that seems self-contradictory or logically unacceptable but may still hold an underlying truth. Paradoxes often challenge our understanding of logic, language, or reality, prompting deeper reflection or revealing hidden complexities. They can be used in philosophical discussions, literature, and even scientific theories to illustrate points that conventional wisdom might overlook. Some well-known examples include:

1. **The Liar Paradox**: "This statement is false." If the statement is true, then it must be false, but if it is false, then it must be true.

2. **The Barber Paradox**: In a town, the barber shaves everyone who does not shave themselves. Does the barber shave himself? If he does, according to the rule, he shouldn't; if he doesn't, he should.

3. **The Paradox of the Unexpected Hanging**: A judge tells a condemned prisoner that he will be hanged at noon on one weekday in the following week but that the execution will be a surprise to the prisoner. The prisoner deduces that he will never be surprised, but the execution still occurs as a surprise.

Paradoxes often highlight the limitations or nuances of our thinking and can inspire new ways of understanding or approaching problems.
