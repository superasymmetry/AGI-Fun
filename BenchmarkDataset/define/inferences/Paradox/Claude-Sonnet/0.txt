A paradox is a statement, situation, or concept that contains contradictory elements that seem logically impossible or absurd, yet may still be true. Paradoxes often appear to defy common sense or create a logical loop that is difficult to resolve.

Some famous examples of paradoxes include:

1. The Liar's Paradox: "This statement is false." (If it's true, then it's false, and if it's false, then it's true)

2. The Ship of Theseus: If every part of a ship is gradually replaced, is it still the same ship?

3. The Grandfather Paradox: If you travel back in time and prevent your grandfather from meeting your grandmother, how could you exist to travel back in time?

Paradoxes can be:
- Logical (containing contradictory elements in reasoning)
- Semantic (arising from ambiguity in language)
- Visual (optical illusions that seem impossible)
- Scientific (apparently contradictory findings)

Paradoxes are often used in philosophy, mathematics, and science to explore the limits of human reasoning and understanding.
