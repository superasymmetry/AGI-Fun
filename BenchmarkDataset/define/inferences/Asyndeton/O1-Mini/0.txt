An asyndeton is a rhetorical device used in writing and speech where conjunctions (such as "and," "or," "but") are deliberately omitted from a series of words, phrases, or clauses. The purpose of using an asyndeton is often to create a sense of speed, urgency, or emphasis. It can make a passage more dramatic or impactful by allowing the ideas to stand out more distinctly or by creating a more rapid rhythm.

For example, Julius Caesar's famous line "Veni, vidi, vici" ("I came, I saw, I conquered") is an example of asyndeton, as it omits the conjunctions that would normally connect the clauses.
