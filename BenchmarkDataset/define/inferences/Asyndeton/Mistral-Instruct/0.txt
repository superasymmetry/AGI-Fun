 Asyndeton is a rhetorical device where a series of words, phrases, or clauses are connected by conjunctions less frequently than is normal or expected, or not at all. This creates a rhythmic, emphatic, and often rapid succession of ideas. For example, in the sentence "I came, I saw, I conquered," by Julius Caesar, the verb phrases are connected without the use of 'and' or other conjunctions, which is an example of asyndeton. This device is often used for dramatic effect.
