An asyndeton is a rhetorical device that involves the omission of conjunctions between successive clauses or phrases. This technique can create a sense of urgency, speed, or emphasis in writing or speech. By leaving out conjunctions like "and," "but," or "or," the sentence can have a more dramatic or impactful effect. For example, Julius Caesar's famous phrase "I came, I saw, I conquered" is an asyndeton, as it lacks the conjunctions that would typically connect the clauses.
