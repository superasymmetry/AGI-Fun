An asyndeton is a literary and rhetorical device that involves the omission of conjunctions between parts of a sentence. This technique is often used to create a sense of speed, urgency, or intensity, as well as to focus attention on the listed words or phrases. By eliminating conjunctions like "and" or "or," the sentence can have a more dramatic and impactful rhythm. For example, Julius Caesar's famous phrase "I came, I saw, I conquered" is an example of asyndeton, as it omits conjunctions to convey a sense of swift and decisive action.
