An asyndeton is a literary device or rhetorical figure of speech in which coordinating conjunctions (such as "and," "or," "but") are deliberately omitted between phrases, clauses, or words in a series. This creates a rapid, punchy effect in the writing and can emphasize each element in the series.

Example: 
- "I came, I saw, I conquered" (Veni, vidi, vici) - Julius Caesar
Instead of: "I came and I saw and I conquered"

- "We shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe" - JFK
Instead of: "We shall pay any price and bear any burden and meet any hardship..."

This technique can create emphasis, build rhythm, or convey urgency and emotional intensity in both written and spoken language.
