### **Example: Shakespeare’s Sonnet 18**  
*"Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?"*  
**(A)** Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?  
**(B)** Thou art more lovely and more temperate:  
**(A)** Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,  
**(B)** And summer’s lease hath all too short a date:  

**(C)** Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,  
**(D)** And often is his gold complexion dimm'd;  
**(C)** And every fair from fair sometime declines,  
**(D)** By chance or nature’s changing course untrimm'd;  

**(E)** But thy eternal summer shall not fade,  
**(F)** Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st;  
**(E)** Nor shall Death brag thou wander’st in his shade,  
**(F)** When in eternal lines to time thou grow’st:  

**(G)** So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,  
**(G)** So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.  

### **Why Is It Significant?**  
Shakespeare’s sonnets (154 in total) are among the most celebrated in English literature, admired for their **emotional depth, linguistic beauty, and structural precision**. The **turn (volta)** often occurs in the final couplet, delivering a surprising or profound conclusion.
