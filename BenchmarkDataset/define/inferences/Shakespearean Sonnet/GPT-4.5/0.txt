A Shakespearean sonnet, also known as an Elizabethan or English sonnet, is a poetic form that consists of 14 lines. Each line is written in iambic pentameter, which means it typically has 10 syllables with an alternating unstressed-stressed pattern. The rhyme scheme of a Shakespearean sonnet is ABABCDCDEFEFGG.

The structure of a Shakespearean sonnet is made up of three quatrains (four-line stanzas) followed by a final couplet (two-line stanza). The quatrains usually explore different facets of the subject or theme, while the concluding couplet offers a resolution, twist, or commentary on the preceding stanzas. This form is particularly associated with William Shakespeare, who popularized it and wrote 154 sonnets using this structure.
