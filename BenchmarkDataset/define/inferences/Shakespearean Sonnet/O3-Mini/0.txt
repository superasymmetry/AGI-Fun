A Shakespearean sonnet, also known as an English sonnet, is a type of sonnet that consists of 14 lines written in iambic pentameter. The structure of a Shakespearean sonnet is divided into three quatrains followed by a final rhymed couplet. The rhyme scheme is typically ABABCDCDEFEFGG. Each quatrain often explores a different aspect of the main theme or builds upon the previous quatrain, with the final couplet providing a resolution or a twist to the poem.

Shakespearean sonnets are known for their thematic exploration of love, beauty, politics, mortality, and nature. William Shakespeare himself authored 154 sonnets, which are celebrated for their lyrical mastery and emotional depth.
