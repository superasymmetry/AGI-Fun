A Shakespearean Sonnet, also known as an English Sonnet, is a 14-line poem written in iambic pentameter, with a specific rhyme scheme and structure. It is named after William Shakespeare, who popularized this form of sonnet in his works.

The structure of a Shakespearean Sonnet consists of:

1. 14 lines, divided into four quatrains (four-line stanzas) and a final couplet (two-line stanza)
2. A rhyme scheme of: ABAB CDCD EFEF GG
3. The first quatrain introduces the theme or subject of the poem
4. The second quatrain develops the idea or theme
5. The third quatrain provides a turn or shift in the poem, often introducing a new idea or perspective
6. The final couplet concludes the poem with a resolution or a comment on the theme

The Shakespearean Sonnet typically follows the iambic pentameter rhythm, which means that each line consists of five feet (syllables) with an unstressed syllable followed by a stressed syllable (da-DUM, da-DUM, da-DUM, da-DUM, da-DUM).

Shakespearean Sonnets often explore themes of love, beauty, mortality, and the passage of time. They are known for their complex metaphors, rich imagery, and clever wordplay, which create a sense of depth and nuance.

Some of Shakespeare's most famous sonnets, such as Sonnet 18 ("Shall I Compare Thee to a Summer's Day?") and Sonnet 130 ("My Mistress' Eyes"), are excellent examples of the Shakespearean Sonnet form.
