Synesis is a grammatical construction where the agreement of words depends on the **meaning** conveyed rather than strict grammatical rules. It's essentially **agreement according to sense, not form.**

Here's a breakdown:

*   **Traditional Grammar:** Normally, words in a sentence (especially subjects and verbs, pronouns and their antecedents) should agree in number, gender, and person. For example, "The dog barks" (singular subject and singular verb) and "They are happy" (plural subject and plural verb).

*   **Synesis:**  Synesis bends or breaks these rules based on how the writer or speaker *intends* the meaning to be understood. The focus is on the underlying concept, not just the grammatical form.

**Here are some key characteristics of synesis:**

*   **Emphasis on Meaning:** The overriding principle is to convey the intended meaning clearly, even if it means deviating from strict grammatical rules.
*   **Collective Nouns:**  Collective nouns (e.g., "team," "family," "committee") are often involved.  While grammatically singular, they can be treated as plural if you're referring to the individual members acting separately.
*   **Vagueness or Ambiguity:** Synesis sometimes arises when the grammatical structure is a little vague or ambiguous, allowing for different interpretations.

**Examples to illustrate synesis:**

1.  **"The team are playing well."**  (Synesis:  "team" is grammatically singular, but the verb "are" suggests we're thinking about the individual players.) A more strictly grammatical form would be, "The team *is* playing well," but *are* is acceptable and common, especially in British English.

2.  **"None of them are here."** (Synesis: While "none" can be singular, it's often interpreted as "not one," implying a plurality. "None of them *is* here" is also grammatically acceptable.)

3.  **"The majority wants to go home."** (Grammatically correct, emphasizing the single group.)  **"The majority want to go home."** (Synesis:  emphasizing the individual members that make up the majority).

4.  **"Everyone is entitled to their opinion."** (Synesis: "Everyone" is singular, but "their" is plural. A strictly grammatically correct form would be "Everyone is entitled to *his or her* opinion," but the gender-neutral "their" is often preferred in modern usage, illustrating synesis.)

**Key Takeaways:**

*   Synesis is about meaning-based agreement, not strictly grammatical agreement.
*   It often involves collective nouns and pronouns that can be interpreted in different ways.
*   It's a recognized rhetorical and grammatical device.
*   While sometimes seen as incorrect by purists, it's often perfectly acceptable and even preferable in certain contexts, especially where it reflects modern usage and avoids awkward or exclusionary language.

In summary, synesis is a flexible approach to grammar that prioritizes clear and natural communication, even if it means bending the traditional rules.
