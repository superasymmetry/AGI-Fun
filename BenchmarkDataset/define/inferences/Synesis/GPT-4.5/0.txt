Synesis is a grammatical construction where the agreement of words is based on meaning rather than strict syntax. This typically involves the use of singular or plural forms depending on how the subject is perceived rather than on grammatical rules. A common example in English is the phrase "A number of people are coming," where "a number" might suggest a singular verb, but "people" governs the verb, so it's plural. Synesis is also known as notional agreement or constructio ad sensum.
