A synesis is a figure of speech in which a word or phrase agrees with a nearby word in one respect (such as number or case) but not in another. It is a type of grammatical construction where a word is used in a way that is not strictly grammatically correct, but is still acceptable and used for rhetorical effect.

In a synesis, a word may agree with a nearby word in terms of its grammatical number (singular or plural), but not in terms of its grammatical case (nominative, accusative, genitive, etc.). For example, in the sentence "The team are going to the store," the verb "are" agrees with the plural noun "team" in number, but not in case (the subject of the sentence is a singular noun, "team").

Synesis is often used in poetry, literature, and informal speech to create a particular effect or to convey a certain meaning. It can be used to emphasize a point, to create a sense of rhythm or meter, or to add emphasis or emotion to a sentence.

It's worth noting that synesis is not always considered "correct" grammar, and some grammarians and language purists may view it as an error. However, in many cases, synesis is a common and accepted feature of language use, and it can be a powerful tool for creating effective and expressive language.
