Synesis is a grammatical construction in which a word or phrase agrees with the sense rather than the strict syntactic form. This means that the agreement is based on meaning rather than the conventional grammatical rules. For example, in the sentence "The committee have decided," the word "committee" is singular in terms of form, but "have" is used rather than "has" because the emphasis is on the individuals within the committee acting collectively, treating it as a plural in meaning. Synesis is often used to achieve a more natural or idiomatic expression, especially in cases where a strict grammatical agreement might sound awkward or misleading.
