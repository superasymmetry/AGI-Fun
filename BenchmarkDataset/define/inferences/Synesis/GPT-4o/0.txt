"Synesis" is a linguistic term referring to a situation where grammatical agreement occurs based on meaning rather than strictly following syntactic rules. This is particularly seen in languages where the logical meaning of the word or phrase influences the agreement of verbs, pronouns, or adjectives, rather than adhering strictly to the grammatical number or gender.

For instance, in English, a collective noun might be treated as either singular or plural depending on whether the group is viewed as a single unit or as individuals. A common example is with the word "team": in American English, it might be followed by a singular verb ("The team is winning"), whereas in British English, it might take a plural verb ("The team are winning") when emphasizing the individual members of the team. Synesis allows a speaker or writer to convey subtle nuances by choosing agreement based on semantic interpretation rather than rigid grammatical structure.
