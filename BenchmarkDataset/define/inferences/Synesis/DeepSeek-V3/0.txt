**Synesis** (from Greek *σύνεσις*, meaning "understanding" or "sense") is a grammatical construction in which agreement or reference is based on meaning rather than strict syntactic form. It occurs when a word takes a grammatical form that aligns with its logical or semantic sense rather than its formal grammatical structure. This is also known as **"notional agreement."**

### **Examples of Synesis:**
1. **Collective Nouns:**  
   - *"The team are arguing among themselves."*  
     (Here, "team" is singular in form but treated as plural because it refers to multiple individuals.)

2. **Plural Subjects with Singular Meaning:**  
   - *"Ten dollars is too much for that."*  
     (Though "dollars" is plural, the amount is treated as a singular sum.)

3. **Relative Pronouns Referring to Meaning:**  
   - *"The government has changed their policy."*  
     (Formally, "government" is singular, but "their" is used to imply multiple officials.)

### **Key Features:**
- **Semantic over Syntactic Agreement:** The meaning of the word dictates agreement rather than strict grammar rules.
- **Common in Informal & British English:** Synesis is more accepted in British English (e.g., *"The committee have decided"*) than in American English, which prefers strict agreement (*"The committee has decided"*).

### **Related Concepts:**
- **Constructio ad Sensum** (Latin for "construction according to sense") is a similar concept in classical rhetoric and grammar.
- **Notional Concord** is another term for the same phenomenon.
