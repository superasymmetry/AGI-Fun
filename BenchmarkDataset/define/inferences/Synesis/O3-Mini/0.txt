Synesis is a grammatical construction where the agreement of words is based on meaning rather than strict grammatical rules. This often involves the use of plural verbs or pronouns with singular nouns when the meaning implies plurality. It's a concept more common in languages that emphasize semantic agreement over formal grammatical agreement. In English, an example of synesis might occur when a phrase like "The team have won" is used instead of "The team has won," with the verb "have" agreeing with the implied plurality of "team" as a collection of individuals rather than with the singular noun form. Synesis can make sentences sound more natural by reflecting how people perceive the subject rather than strictly adhering to grammatical rules.
