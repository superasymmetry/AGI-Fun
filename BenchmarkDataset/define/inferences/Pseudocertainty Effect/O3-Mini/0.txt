The pseudocertainty effect is a cognitive bias associated with decision-making under risk. It refers to the tendency for people to favor options that offer certainty in one stage of a multi-stage decision process, even if these options might not be the best choice overall. This effect is part of prospect theory, developed by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, which describes how individuals evaluate potential losses and gains.

In situations where decisions have multiple stages, people often evaluate the certainty of outcomes within each stage rather than considering the overall probability of outcomes across all stages. As a result, they may make choices that provide a sense of certainty in the short term, despite these choices being suboptimal when considering the entire decision-making process. This can lead individuals to prefer a certain outcome in one stage rather than a better cumulative probability of a favorable outcome when considering all stages together.
