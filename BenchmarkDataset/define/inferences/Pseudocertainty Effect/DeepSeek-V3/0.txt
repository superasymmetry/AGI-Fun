The **pseudocertainty effect** is a cognitive bias where people perceive an outcome as certain when it is actually uncertain, often due to the way choices are framed. This effect occurs when individuals treat a probable outcome as if it were guaranteed, especially in multi-stage decision-making scenarios.

### Key Features of the Pseudocertainty Effect:
1. **Framing Dependence**: It arises when options are presented in a way that makes a risky outcome seem inevitable or guaranteed, even when it isn't.
2. **Risk Perception**: People may overestimate the certainty of a positive outcome if it is framed as the final stage of a sequence (e.g., after a prior "safe" step).
3. **Contrast with True Certainty**: Unlike real certainty, the pseudocertainty effect involves an illusion of safety or assurance, leading to suboptimal risk-taking.

### Example:
A classic example comes from **Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman** (1986):
- **Scenario 1**: A two-stage game where:  
  - Stage 1: 75% chance to lose, 25% chance to advance to Stage 2.  
  - Stage 2: Choice between a "certain" win (e.g., $30) or an 80% chance to win $45.  
  - Many people choose the "certain" $30 in Stage 2, even though the actual probability of winning it is only 25% (due to Stage 1’s risk).  
- **Scenario 2**: A direct choice between a 25% chance to win $30 vs. a 20% chance (25% × 80%) to win $45. Here, people often prefer the riskier $45 option.  

In Scenario 1, the "certain" win in Stage 2 feels guaranteed (pseudocertainty), while in Scenario 2, the uncertainty is more transparent.

### Relation to Other Biases:
- Similar to the **certainty effect** (overweighting guaranteed outcomes), but pseudocertainty specifically involves false perceptions of certainty.  
- Contrasts with **probability neglect**, where people ignore probabilities altogether.

### Practical Implications:
- Influences financial decisions, health behaviors, and policy-making when outcomes are framed as sequential or contingent.  
- Explains why people may take undue risks (or avoid them) based on misleading representations of certainty.

In summary, the pseudocertainty effect highlights how framing can distort our perception of risk, making uncertain outcomes appear more certain than they truly are.
