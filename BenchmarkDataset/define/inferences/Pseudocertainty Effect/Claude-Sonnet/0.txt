The pseudocertainty effect is a cognitive bias where people tend to make risk-averse choices when dealing with guaranteed gains and risk-seeking choices when dealing with guaranteed losses, regardless of the actual probabilities involved. This bias occurs when people incorrectly evaluate probabilities in multi-stage decision processes.

Key aspects of the pseudocertainty effect:

1. Decision framing:
- People react differently to the same scenario when it's presented in different ways
- The way outcomes are framed influences risk preferences

2. Two-stage processes:
- Often involves decisions with multiple stages
- People tend to ignore the probability of reaching the second stage

3. Main characteristics:
- Risk aversion for guaranteed gains
- Risk seeking for guaranteed losses
- Violation of rational decision-making principles

4. Real-world applications:
- Financial decisions
- Medical treatment choices
- Insurance purchases
- Gambling behavior

5. Relation to other biases:
- Connected to prospect theory
- Similar to certainty effect
- Related to framing effects

The pseudocertainty effect helps explain why people make seemingly irrational decisions when faced with complex probability scenarios.
