The pseudocertainty effect is a cognitive bias that influences decision-making under risk and uncertainty. It describes the tendency for people to perceive an outcome as certain when in fact it is uncertain, often by simplifying complex probabilities into seemingly more manageable dichotomies. This effect is particularly evident when people evaluate sequences of risky decisions and focus on the final outcomes without considering the cumulative probabilities involved.

For example, individuals might overweight the likelihood of a positive outcome in the final stage of a decision sequence, assuming a certain level of "certainty" that doesn't exist. The pseudocertainty effect is closely related to the framing effect, where the way information is presented (or framed) influences perception and decision-making. In essence, the pseudocertainty effect can lead to suboptimal decisions because it distorts the understanding of risk by presenting uncertain outcomes as more definite than they are.
