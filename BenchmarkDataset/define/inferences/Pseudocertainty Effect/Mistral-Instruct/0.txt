 The Pseudocertainty Effect, also known as the Illusion of Precision, is a cognitive bias that causes people to overestimate the precision of their knowledge or judgments. This means that individuals may believe their answers or beliefs are more accurate and certain than they actually are, especially when the answers are vague or based on limited information.

For example, when asked to estimate the number of jellybeans in a jar, a person might provide a specific number, even though the actual number is unknown. The Pseudocertainty Effect occurs when the individual believes their estimate is precise and exact, rather than an approximation. This bias can lead to overconfidence, poor decision-making, and miscommunication in various situations, such as financial forecasting, medical diagnoses, and legal judgments.
