The pseudocertainty effect is a type of cognitive bias where individuals make decisions based on an illusion of certainty in uncertain situations. It occurs when people perceive an outcome as certain and are influenced by that perception, even when the certainty is not real. This effect often leads to risk-averse behavior in gain scenarios and risk-seeking behavior in loss scenarios. It is related to the framing effect and is part of prospect theory, which describes how people choose between probabilistic alternatives that involve risk. The pseudocertainty effect shows how framing a decision in a certain way can lead individuals to perceive greater certainty than actually exists, thereby impacting their decision-making process.
