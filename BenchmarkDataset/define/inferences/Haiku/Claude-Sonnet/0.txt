A haiku is a short form of Japanese poetry that consists of three unrhyming lines. The traditional structure follows this pattern:

1. First line: 5 syllables
2. Second line: 7 syllables
3. Third line: 5 syllables

Traditionally, haikus often contain a seasonal reference (kigo) and a cutting word (kireji) that creates a break or pause in thought. They typically capture a fleeting moment in nature or evoke a particular feeling or image.

Here's an example of a famous haiku by Matsuo Bash≈ç:

An old silent pond
A frog jumps into the pond
Splash! Silence again

While this structure is traditional in Japanese, modern haikus in other languages sometimes vary from these strict rules while maintaining the spirit of brevity and imagery.
