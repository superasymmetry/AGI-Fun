A haiku is a traditional form of Japanese poetry. It's characterized by its three-line structure and a specific syllable count per line. Here's the breakdown:

*   **Line 1:** 5 syllables
*   **Line 2:** 7 syllables
*   **Line 3:** 5 syllables

**Key characteristics of haiku:**

*   **Kigo (Seasonal Word):** Traditionally, haiku include a *kigo*, a word or phrase that indicates the season being described.
*   **Juxtaposition (Kireji):** Often, a haiku features a "cutting word" (*kireji*), a word that creates a pause or break, often implying a comparison or contrast between two images or ideas. While modern haiku sometimes omit the kireji, the element of juxtaposition remains important.
*   **Nature and Simplicity:** Haiku often focus on nature, everyday life, and moments of observation. They aim to capture a fleeting feeling or experience in a simple and concise way.
*   **Imagery:** Strong imagery is crucial. Haiku paint a picture with few words, leaving room for the reader's imagination.
*   **Emotional Resonance:** The best haiku evoke a feeling or thought in the reader beyond the literal description.

**Example:**

Old silent pond…
A frog jumps into the pond—
Splash! Silence again.

*(This is a classic haiku by Matsuo Bashō. Notice the season isn't explicitly stated, but the frog implies spring.)*
