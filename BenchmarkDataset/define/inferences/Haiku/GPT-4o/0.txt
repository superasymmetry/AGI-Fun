A haiku is a traditional form of Japanese poetry that consists of three lines with a total of 17 syllables. The structure of a haiku is typically divided into lines of 5, 7, and 5 syllables, respectively. Haikus often capture a moment in nature or an emotion, offering a brief and evocative reflection. They traditionally include a seasonal reference, known as a "kigo," and aim to evoke a specific mood or atmosphere with their simplicity and depth.
