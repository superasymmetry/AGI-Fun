A haiku is a traditional form of Japanese poetry that typically consists of three lines with a syllabic pattern of 5-7-5. The aim of a haiku is to capture a moment, mood, or aspect of nature with simplicity and depth. It often includes a seasonal reference, known as a kigo, and a cutting word, or kireji, that adds a pause or separates contrasting ideas. While the syllable structure is followed strictly in Japanese, English haikus may vary slightly due to language differences, but they retain the essence of brevity and evocative imagery.
