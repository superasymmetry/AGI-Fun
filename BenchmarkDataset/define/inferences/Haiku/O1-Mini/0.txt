A haiku is a traditional form of Japanese poetry that consists of three lines with a specific syllabic pattern. The first line has five syllables, the second line has seven syllables, and the third line has five syllables, making a total of 17 syllables. Haikus often focus on nature, seasons, or specific moments, capturing a fleeting experience or deep emotion in a concise, vivid way. They typically include a "kigo" (seasonal reference) and a "kireji" (cutting word) that provides a pause or contrast in the poem.
