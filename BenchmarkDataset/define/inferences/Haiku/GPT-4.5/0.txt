A haiku is a traditional form of Japanese poetry that consists of three lines with a total of 17 syllables arranged in a 5-7-5 pattern. The poems often focus on nature, seasons, or moments of beauty and simplicity. Haikus aim to capture a fleeting moment or an insight, and they usually contain a seasonal reference, known as a "kigo," to anchor the poem in a specific time of year. Haikus are appreciated for their ability to evoke emotions and thoughts through concise and vivid imagery.
