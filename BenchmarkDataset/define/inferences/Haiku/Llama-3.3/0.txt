A haiku is a traditional form of Japanese poetry that consists of three lines with a syllable count of 5, 7, and 5. Haiku typically capture a moment in time or express a feeling or image. They often incorporate natural imagery and use sensory language to create a sense of wonder, peace, and simplicity.

The structure of a haiku is usually as follows:

* The first line has five syllables and sets the scene or introduces the main image.
* The second line has seven syllables and develops the idea or introduces a contrast or twist.
* The third line has five syllables and provides a conclusion or a final thought.

Haiku often use imagery and suggestion rather than direct statement, and they may incorporate a "season word" (known as a kigo) to help establish the time and setting of the poem.

Here's an example of a haiku:

Snowflakes gently fall  
Blanketing the winter scene  
Peaceful silence deep
