A **haiku** is a traditional form of Japanese poetry consisting of **three lines** with a **5-7-5 syllable structure** (5 syllables in the first line, 7 in the second, and 5 in the third).  

Haikus often focus on **nature, seasons, or a fleeting moment**, capturing a vivid image or emotion with simplicity and depth.  

### **Example of a Haiku:**  
*An old silent pond…*  
*A frog jumps into the pond—*  
*Splash! Silence again.*  
— **Matsuo Bashō** (translated)
