An anapest is a metrical foot used in poetry. It consists of three syllables: the first two syllables are unstressed followed by a third syllable that is stressed. This pattern can be represented as da-da-DUM. It is often used to create a rhythmic effect in lines of poetry, lending a sense of movement or emphasis. Anapestic meter is commonly used in light or comedic verse but can also appear in more serious poetry to provide a particular rhythm or mood. For example, the word "understand" is an anapest.
