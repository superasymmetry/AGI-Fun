An anapest is a metrical foot in poetry that consists of three syllables, where the first two syllables are unstressed and the third syllable is stressed. It follows a pattern of da-da-DUM. This rhythmic structure is commonly used to create a flowing, rolling cadence in poetic lines. Anapestic meter is often found in light or whimsical poetry, but it can also be used in more serious contexts. For example, the word "understand" is an anapestic because the syllable stress pattern follows the da-da-DUM rhythm. When a poet uses anapestic meter repeatedly, it is often called anapestic meter or anapestic verse. One famous example of anapestic meter can be found in the works of Dr. Seuss and in the poem "The Night Before Christmas" by Clement Clarke Moore.
