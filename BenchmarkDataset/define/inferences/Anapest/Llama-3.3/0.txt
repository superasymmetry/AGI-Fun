An anapest is a metrical foot in poetry, consisting of three syllables with an unstressed, unstressed, stressed pattern (da-da-DUM). It is often used to create a lively, playful, or humorous effect in verse. Anapestic meter is commonly used in lighthearted or comedic poetry, and is particularly associated with the works of poets such as Edward Lear and Lewis Carroll.
