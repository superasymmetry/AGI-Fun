An anapest is a type of poetic foot consisting of two unstressed syllables followed by a stressed syllable. It is often used in poetry and verse to create a rhythmic pattern. The word "anapest" comes from the Greek word "anapestos," which means "to strike back." An example of an anapest is the word "uncomfortable," which has two unstressed syllables ("un-com") followed by a stressed syllable ("fort-a-ble").
