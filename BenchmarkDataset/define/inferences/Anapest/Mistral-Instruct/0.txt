 An anapest is a type of metrical foot in poetry, consisting of three syllables with a short-short-long stress pattern. The short syllables are unstressed, and the long syllable is stressed. For example, in the phrase "I have not", "I" is an unstressed short syllable, "have" is an unstressed short syllable, and "not" is a stressed long syllable. Anapest is one of the three common metrical feet, along with iamb and trochee.
