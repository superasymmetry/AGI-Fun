An anapest is a metrical foot used in poetry. It consists of **two unstressed syllables followed by one stressed syllable.**

Think of it like this: **da-da-DUM**.

Here are some examples:

*   **in the WAY**
*   **on a BOAT**
*   **to be FREE**
*   **disappear**
*   **understand**

Lines written primarily in anapests are often used to create a feeling of speed and movement.

For example, consider this line written in anapestic tetrameter (four anapests per line):

*   And the **sound** of the **waves** on the **shore** far a**way**.  (da-da-DUM da-da-DUM da-da-DUM da-da-DUM)
