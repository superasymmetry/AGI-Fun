An anapest is a metrical foot in poetry that consists of three syllables: two unstressed syllables followed by one stressed syllable (da-da-DUM). Examples of words with anapestic rhythm include "understand," "intervene," and "comprehend." This meter is often used to create a rolling, galloping rhythm in poetry, as famously demonstrated in Lord Byron's "The Destruction of Sennacherib" which begins: "The Assyrian came down like the wolf on the fold."
