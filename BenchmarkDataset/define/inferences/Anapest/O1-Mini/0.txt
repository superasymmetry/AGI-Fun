An anapest is a metrical foot in poetry that consists of three syllables: two short or unstressed syllables followed by one long or stressed syllable. This pattern creates a da-da-DUM rhythm when read aloud. Anapestic meter is often used in English poetry to convey a lively or whimsical tone and is commonly found in light verse, children's poetry, and some narrative poems. An example of anapestic meter is found in the line: "And the sound of a voice that is still," where "and the sound" and "that is still" each follow the anapestic pattern.
