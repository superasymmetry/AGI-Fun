An anapest is a metrical foot in poetry consisting of three syllables: two short or unstressed syllables followed by one long or stressed syllable. The pattern can be represented as da-da-DUM. This rhythmic structure often creates a flowing, lively, and rhythmic quality in the verses where it is employed. An example of anapestic meter is found in the line from Clement Clarke Moore's famous poem, "’Twas the night before Christmas": 

"’Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house" 

Here, the pattern of unstressed and stressed syllables follows the anapestic meter.
