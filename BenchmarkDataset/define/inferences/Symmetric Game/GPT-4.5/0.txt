In game theory, a symmetric game is one where the payoffs for playing a particular strategy depend only on the other strategies employed, not on who is playing them. This means that the identities of the players do not matter, and each player has access to the same strategies and gets the same payoffs when they choose identical strategies.

Formally, a game is symmetric if the payoff functions are invariant under any permutation of the players. In a two-player symmetric game, this implies that the payoff matrix for one player is the transpose of the payoff matrix for the other player. As a result, both players face the same strategic environment and have the same incentives.

A classic example of a symmetric game is the "Prisoner's Dilemma," where both players have the same set of strategies and the payoffs depend only on the combination of strategies chosen, not on which player chooses them. Other examples include "The Hawk-Dove Game" and "The Battle of the Sexes," though the latter can be represented in a symmetric format only under specific assumptions about preferences. Symmetric games are important in analyzing situations where players can be considered interchangeable, and they often allow for more straightforward analysis and solution concepts like Nash equilibrium.
