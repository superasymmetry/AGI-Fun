A symmetric game is a game in which all players have identical strategy sets and payoffs for playing particular strategies. In other words, the payoffs for playing a particular strategy depend only on the strategies chosen by the other players, not on who is playing them. All players can be interchanged without changing the game's fundamental structure.

Key characteristics:
1. All players have the same available strategies
2. The payoffs for playing each strategy are the same for all players
3. Switching the positions of any players doesn't change the game

Common examples include:
- Prisoner's Dilemma
- Hawk-Dove game
- Rock, Paper, Scissors

The opposite is an asymmetric game, where players have different strategies and/or payoffs available to them.
