In game theory, strict dominance occurs when one strategy is strictly better than another strategy for a player, regardless of what strategies other players choose. A strictly dominated strategy will always yield a lower payoff than the dominating strategy, no matter what the other players do.

For example:
- Strategy A strictly dominates Strategy B if the payoff from A is always higher than B
- The dominated strategy (B) can be eliminated from consideration since a rational player would never choose it
- This concept helps simplify game analysis through iterative elimination of strictly dominated strategies

Rational players should never play strictly dominated strategies, as they can always do better by choosing the dominating strategy instead.
