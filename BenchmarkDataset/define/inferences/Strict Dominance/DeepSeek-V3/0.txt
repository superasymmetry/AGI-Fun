In game theory, **strict dominance** occurs when one strategy is always better than another, no matter what the other players do. 

### Formal Definition:
A strategy **s_i** for player *i* is **strictly dominated** by another strategy **s_i'** if, for every possible combination of the other players' strategies, the payoff for player *i* from choosing **s_i'** is strictly greater than the payoff from choosing **s_i**:

\[
u_i(s_i', s_{-i}) > u_i(s_i, s_{-i}) \quad \text{for all} \quad s_{-i}
\]

where:
- \( u_i \) is the payoff function for player *i*,
- \( s_{-i} \) represents the strategies of all other players.

### Key Implications:
1. **Rational players never play strictly dominated strategies** because there is always a better alternative.
2. **Iterated elimination of strictly dominated strategies (IESDS)** is a solution concept where players iteratively remove dominated strategies to simplify the game.
3. **A strictly dominant strategy** (if it exists) is one that strictly dominates all other strategies for a player.

### Example:
Consider the following payoff matrix for Player 1 (row player) in a two-player game:

|               | Player 2: L | Player 2: R |
|---------------|------------|------------|
| **Player 1: U** | 3          | 1          |
| **Player 1: D** | 4          | 2          |

Here, **D strictly dominates U** because:
- If Player 2 plays **L**, Player 1 gets 4 (D) > 3 (U).
- If Player 2 plays **R**, Player 1 gets 2 (D) > 1 (U).

Thus, a rational Player 1 will never choose **U**.

### Contrast with Weak Dominance:
- **Strict dominance**: One strategy is always better.
- **Weak dominance**: One strategy is never worse and sometimes better.

Strict dominance is a stronger concept and is particularly useful for predicting rational behavior in games.
