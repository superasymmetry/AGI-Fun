In game theory, strict dominance refers to a situation where one strategy is always better than another strategy, regardless of what the other players do. In other words, a strategy is strictly dominated if there exists another strategy that yields a higher payoff for a player, no matter what strategies the other players choose. A strictly dominated strategy is never a best response to any strategy of the other players, and therefore it can be eliminated from the game without affecting the outcome. The elimination of strictly dominated strategies is a common technique used in game theory to simplify the analysis of strategic interactions.
