In game theory, strict dominance refers to a situation where one strategy is better than another strategy for a player, regardless of what the other players do. More formally, a strategy \( A \) strictly dominates another strategy \( B \) if, for every possible set of strategies chosen by the other players, the payoff from choosing \( A \) is strictly greater than the payoff from choosing \( B \).

This concept is crucial in simplifying the analysis of strategic games because if a player has a strictly dominated strategy, it can be eliminated from consideration without affecting the outcome. Therefore, rational players would never play a strictly dominated strategy, since there is always a better option available to them. Eliminating strictly dominated strategies can often simplify complex games by reducing the strategy space and making it easier to find equilibrium solutions, such as Nash equilibria.
