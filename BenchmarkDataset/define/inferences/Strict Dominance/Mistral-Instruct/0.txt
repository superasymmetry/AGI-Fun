 In game theory, strict dominance refers to a situation where one strategy is always better than another strategy for a player, regardless of what other players do. In other words, a strategy is said to strictly dominate another strategy if it provides a higher payoff in every possible outcome.

For example, consider a two-player game where each player simultaneously chooses either "Rock", "Paper", or "Scissors". If Player A always chooses "Scissors" and Player B can choose either "Rock" or "Paper", and Player A beats Player B with "Scissors" if Player B chooses "Paper", and loses to Player B if Player B chooses "Rock", then "Scissors" strictly dominates both "Rock" and "Paper" for Player A, because Player A always gets a higher payoff (a win) against Player B, no matter what Player B chooses.

Strict dominance is important in game theory because it helps players to identify and eliminate weak strategies, and to focus on strategies that are more likely to lead to a better outcome. However, it's important to note that not all games have strategies that are strictly dominated, and in some cases, a strategy that is not strictly dominated may still be a weak choice due to other factors, such as the presence of other dominance relationships or the overall structure of the game.
