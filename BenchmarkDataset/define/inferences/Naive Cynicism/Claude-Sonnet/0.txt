Naive cynicism is a cognitive bias where people tend to believe that others are more motivated by self-interest and selfishness than they actually are. It involves assuming that other people's actions are primarily driven by egoistic or manipulative motives, even when this may not be the case.

Key aspects of naive cynicism include:

1. Overestimating others' self-interest:
- Assuming people act mainly for personal gain
- Attributing altruistic behavior to hidden selfish motives
- Underestimating genuine prosocial motivations

2. Self-other discrepancy:
- Viewing oneself as more ethical and altruistic than others
- Believing others are more likely to act unethically
- Maintaining a more positive self-image compared to views of others

3. Impact on behavior:
- Increased skepticism toward others' intentions
- Reduced trust in social interactions
- Potential self-fulfilling prophecy in relationships

4. Common manifestations:
- Politics (assuming politicians are always corrupt)
- Business (expecting others to cheat or take advantage)
- Personal relationships (doubting others' sincerity)

Understanding naive cynicism is important because it can affect:
- Trust building
- Cooperation
- Social relationships
- Decision making
- Interpersonal dynamics
