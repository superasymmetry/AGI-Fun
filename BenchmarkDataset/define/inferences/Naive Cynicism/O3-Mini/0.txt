Naive cynicism is a psychological bias where individuals expect others to act primarily out of self-interest, often underestimating the genuine motives or altruistic intentions of others. This bias can lead individuals to be overly skeptical of others' actions and intentions, assuming that people are motivated by selfish desires even when evidence might suggest otherwise. Naive cynicism can result in misjudgments and strained relationships, as it may cause people to overlook or dismiss the positive and cooperative aspects of human behavior. It contrasts with naive realism, which is the belief that one's own perspective is objective and unbiased, while others' views are seen as distorted by personal biases.
