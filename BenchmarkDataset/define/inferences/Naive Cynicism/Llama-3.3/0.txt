Naive cynicism is a psychological bias that refers to the tendency for people to believe that others are more selfish and manipulative than they actually are. This bias involves overestimating the extent to which others are motivated by self-interest and underestimating the role of altruism and genuine kindness in their behavior.

In essence, naive cynics assume that others are more cynical and self-serving than they really are, and this assumption can lead to a range of negative consequences, including:

1. Mistrust: Naive cynics may be less likely to trust others, even when trust is warranted.
2. Misinterpretation: They may misinterpret others' actions as self-serving or manipulative, even when they are not.
3. Defensiveness: Naive cynics may become overly defensive or guarded in their interactions with others, which can lead to conflict and misunderstandings.
4. Missed opportunities: By assuming the worst about others, naive cynics may miss out on opportunities for cooperation, collaboration, and mutual benefit.

Naive cynicism can be contrasted with a more balanced and realistic view of human nature, which recognizes that people are capable of both self-interest and altruism. By being aware of this bias, individuals can work to overcome it and develop more positive and trusting relationships with others.
