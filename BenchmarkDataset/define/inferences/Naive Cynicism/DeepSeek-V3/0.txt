**Naive cynicism** is a psychological bias where individuals *expect others to be more selfish, biased, or less fair-minded than they actually are*. It’s a form of cognitive distortion rooted in overly pessimistic assumptions about others' motives, often leading to misinterpretations of behavior or intentions.

### Key Features of Naive Cynicism:
1. **Underestimating Others' Fairness**: Assuming people are more self-interested or dishonest than they truly are (e.g., misjudging a colleague's neutral feedback as intentionally harsh).
2. **Projection of Bias**: Believing others are as biased as oneself, even when evidence suggests otherwise. This contrasts with *naive realism* (the belief that one's own perceptions are purely objective).
3. **Misattribution of Intent**: Attributing others' actions to malice or ulterior motives when situational factors or innocent explanations exist (similar to the *fundamental attribution error*).

### Examples:
- **Politics**: Assuming an opponent’s policy proposal is solely for personal gain, ignoring potential genuine concern.
- **Workplace**: Interpreting a manager’s critique as personal dislike rather than constructive feedback.
- **Relationships**: Presuming a friend’s late reply signals indifference, not a busy schedule.

### Contrast with Related Biases:
- **Naive Realism**: The belief that one sees reality objectively, while others are biased.
- **Cynical Hostility**: A broader personality trait of distrusting others’ motives, linked to negative health outcomes.

### Why It Matters:
Naive cynicism can fuel conflict, reduce cooperation, and create self-fulfilling prophecies (e.g., distrusting others may provoke guarded behavior). Recognizing it helps foster more accurate social judgments and healthier interactions.

**In short**, naive cynicism is the tendency to overestimate others' selfishness or bias, distorting social perceptions. It’s a reminder that excessive skepticism can be as misleading as excessive trust.
