 Naive cynicism, also known as cynical realism, is a psychological bias where an individual holds a generalized negative view of others' intentions, assuming that people are primarily motivated by self-interest rather than altruism or good intentions. This bias can lead to a pessimistic outlook and mistrust of others, even in situations where there is no evidence to support such a view.

It's important to note that while a healthy level of skepticism can be beneficial in some situations, excessive or unfounded cynicism can lead to social isolation, strained relationships, and missed opportunities. It's always important to approach situations with an open mind and consider the possibility that people may have good intentions, unless there is clear evidence to the contrary.
