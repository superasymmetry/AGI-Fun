Na誰ve cynicism is a cognitive bias wherein people expect others to be more selfish or egocentric in their intentions and actions than they actually might be. This bias leads individuals to assume that others are primarily motivated by self-interest, even in situations where altruism or cooperative behavior might be present. Na誰ve cynicism can result in misinterpretations of others' behaviors and motives, fostering distrust and skepticism. This bias contrasts with "na誰ve realism," where individuals believe their perception of reality is the only valid one, and that those who disagree are uninformed, irrational, or biased. Na誰ve cynicism can influence social interactions and decision-making processes, often leading people to underestimate the goodwill and cooperative intentions of others.
