Naive cynicism is a cognitive bias where individuals assume that others are more biased or motivated by self-interest than they themselves are. It involves a skeptical attitude towards others' intentions or actions, often believing that people are purely driven by egoism or self-serving motives. This bias can lead to misunderstandings and conflict, as one's assumptions about others' motivations might not accurately reflect reality. Naive cynicism contrasts with naive realism, where individuals believe they see the world objectively and others who disagree are uninformed, irrational, or biased. In essence, naive cynicism involves an exaggerated perception that others are less trustworthy or more manipulative than they actually are.
