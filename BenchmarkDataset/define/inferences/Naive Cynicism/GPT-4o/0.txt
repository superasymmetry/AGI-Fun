Naive cynicism is a psychological bias wherein individuals assume that others are primarily motivated by self-interest and are likely to act in ways that are selfish or manipulative, even when there is no clear evidence to support this belief. This bias leads individuals to be overly skeptical of others' intentions and to underestimate the impact of situational factors or genuine altruism in others' behavior. Naive cynicism contrasts with naive realism, where people believe that they perceive the world objectively and that others who disagree with them are uninformed, irrational, or biased. Naive cynicism can complicate interpersonal relationships and negotiations by fostering mistrust and reduced cooperation.
