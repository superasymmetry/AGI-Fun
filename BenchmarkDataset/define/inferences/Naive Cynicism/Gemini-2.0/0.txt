Naive cynicism is a cognitive bias where individuals **overestimate the extent to which other people are motivated by selfish reasons.** It's the tendency to believe that others are more self-interested and less altruistic than they actually are.

Here's a breakdown of the key aspects:

*   **Overestimation of Selfishness:** People exhibiting naive cynicism assume that others' actions are primarily driven by hidden agendas, ulterior motives, and a desire for personal gain. They believe that other people are more likely to act in ways that benefit themselves, even at the expense of others.

*   **Underestimation of Altruism:** Conversely, they underestimate the genuine compassion, generosity, and good intentions of others. They're skeptical of acts of kindness, often attributing them to self-serving motivations or a desire for social approval rather than genuine altruism.

*   **"Naive" Nature:** The term "naive" highlights that this cynicism is often based on a simplistic or incomplete understanding of human behavior. It suggests a lack of awareness of the complexities of human motivation, which can include genuine empathy, cooperation, and a desire to contribute to the greater good.

**Examples of Naive Cynicism:**

*   Assuming that someone volunteering at a homeless shelter is only doing it to look good on their college application.
*   Believing that a politician's support for a charitable cause is just a calculated move to win votes.
*   Suspecting that a colleague who offers to help with a project is secretly trying to take credit for your work.
*   Discounting a friend's act of kindness as a way to manipulate you into doing them a favor later.

**Consequences of Naive Cynicism:**

*   **Damaged Relationships:** Mistrust and suspicion can erode trust and hinder the development of genuine connections with others.
*   **Reduced Cooperation:** If you believe that others are inherently selfish, you may be less likely to cooperate or collaborate with them.
*   **Increased Isolation:** Cynical beliefs can lead to social isolation, as individuals may withdraw from social interactions and become less willing to engage in cooperative ventures.
*   **Negative Worldview:** A pervasive sense of cynicism can foster a negative and pessimistic outlook on the world.

**Distinction from other biases:**

*   **Naive Realism:** This is the belief that one sees the world objectively, and that those who disagree are misinformed, irrational, or biased.  Naive cynicism and naive realism can coexist, as someone might believe they are seeing the world "as it is" and recognize the selfish motives behind the actions of others.
*   **Hostile Attribution Bias:** This involves interpreting the ambiguous behavior of others as hostile or aggressive. While related to cynicism, it specifically focuses on perceiving hostility rather than general selfishness.

In conclusion, naive cynicism is a common cognitive bias that leads people to underestimate the good intentions of others and overestimate the influence of self-interest in their actions. This can have detrimental effects on relationships, cooperation, and overall well-being. Recognizing and challenging naive cynical beliefs is important for fostering trust and building positive social connections.
