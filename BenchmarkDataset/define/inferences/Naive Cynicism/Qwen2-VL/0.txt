Naive cynicism is a psychological bias that refers to the tendency to believe that others are more likely to engage in negative or unethical behavior than oneself. It is characterized by a lack of trust in others and a belief that people are inherently selfish or dishonest. This bias can lead to a negative outlook on life and a tendency to be overly suspicious of others. It is important to recognize and challenge naive cynicism in order to maintain healthy relationships and a positive outlook on life.
