Pareto optimality is a concept in game theory that refers to a situation in which no one can be made better off without making someone else worse off. In other words, a Pareto optimal outcome is one in which it is impossible to improve the situation of one person without worsening the situation of another. This concept is named after Vilfredo Pareto, an Italian economist who first introduced it in the late 19th century.
Pareto optimality is often used as a criterion for evaluating the efficiency of economic systems or social arrangements. For example, a policy or decision is said to be Pareto optimal if it results in a distribution of resources or outcomes that cannot be improved upon without making someone worse off. This means that any attempt to improve the situation of one person would necessarily result in a loss for someone else.
It is important to note that Pareto optimality does not necessarily imply fairness or equality. A Pareto optimal outcome could still be highly unequal or unfair, as long as it is not possible to make anyone better off without making someone else worse off.
