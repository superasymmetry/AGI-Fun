In game theory, **Pareto optimality (also known as Pareto efficiency)** is a state of allocation of resources from which it is impossible to reallocate to make any one individual or criterion better off without making at least one individual or criterion worse off.

Here's a breakdown of what that means:

*   **Allocation of resources:** This refers to the distribution of goods, services, or other resources among individuals or groups.
*   **Impossible to reallocate:**  This means that any change to the existing distribution will inevitably harm someone.
*   **Make any one individual or criterion better off:** This implies increasing the satisfaction, utility, or outcome for a particular person or entity.
*   **Without making at least one individual or criterion worse off:**  This is the key condition. If improving one person *requires* harming another, then the original allocation might already be Pareto optimal.

**In simpler terms:**

Imagine you're dividing a cake between two people. A Pareto optimal division is one where you can't give either person more cake without taking some away from the other.  There might be multiple Pareto optimal ways to divide the cake (e.g., one person gets almost all of it, they each get half, etc.), but each represents a situation where further improvements for one person come at the expense of the other.

**Key points to remember about Pareto optimality:**

*   **It doesn't guarantee fairness or equality:** A distribution where one person has everything and the others have nothing can be Pareto optimal, as long as giving anything to the others would require taking it away from the person who has everything.
*   **It's a benchmark for efficiency, not desirability:**  A Pareto optimal allocation is simply one that cannot be improved upon in terms of making someone better off without harming someone else. It doesn't necessarily mean it's a good or just outcome.
*   **It's a relative concept:** Pareto optimality depends on the initial distribution of resources.
*   **Many outcomes can be Pareto optimal:**  There isn't just one Pareto optimal outcome in most situations.
*   **Pareto improvement:** A change that makes at least one individual better off without making any other individual worse off is called a Pareto improvement.  Moving from a Pareto suboptimal state to a Pareto optimal state involves one or more Pareto improvements.
*   **Applications:** Pareto optimality is a fundamental concept in economics, game theory, and public policy, used to evaluate the efficiency of resource allocation, policy choices, and market outcomes.

**Example:**

Let's say two people, Alice and Bob, have 10 apples to divide.  Here are a few possible allocations and whether they are Pareto optimal:

*   **Alice: 5 apples, Bob: 5 apples:** This is likely Pareto optimal.  Giving Alice more apples would require taking them from Bob, and vice versa.
*   **Alice: 10 apples, Bob: 0 apples:** This is also Pareto optimal. Giving Bob any apples would require taking them from Alice.
*   **Alice: 4 apples, Bob: 4 apples:** This is NOT Pareto optimal. There are 2 apples remaining. Giving one apple to Alice and one to Bob would be a Pareto improvement (both are better off), or giving both to one person would also be a Pareto improvement.

In summary, Pareto optimality is a key concept in understanding efficiency in resource allocation and game outcomes, highlighting situations where no further improvements can be made without harming someone. However, it's important to remember that it's just one criterion and doesn't address fairness or other considerations.
