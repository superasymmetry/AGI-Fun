In game theory, iterated dominance is a solution concept used to analyze strategic interactions between rational players. It is a method for eliminating strategies that are strictly dominated by other strategies, and then repeating the process until no further eliminations can be made.
A strategy is said to be strictly dominated if there exists another strategy that always yields a higher payoff, regardless of the strategies chosen by the other players. In other words, a strictly dominated strategy is always worse than some other strategy, and therefore rational players would never choose to play it.
Iterated dominance involves repeatedly eliminating strictly dominated strategies from the set of available strategies until no further eliminations can be made. This process can help to simplify the analysis of a game by reducing the number of strategies that need to be considered.
For example, consider a simple game with two players, A and B, each of whom can choose between two strategies, X and Y. The payoff matrix for the game is as follows:
| | X | Y |
|---|---|---|
| X | 1,1 | 0,2 |
| Y | 2,0 | 1,1 |
In this game, strategy Y is strictly dominated by strategy X for player A, since choosing X always yields a higher payoff than choosing Y, regardless of what player B does. Therefore, we can eliminate strategy Y for player A from consideration.
After eliminating strategy Y for player A, we are left with the following simplified game:
| | X |
|---|---|
| X | 1,1 |
| Y | 2,0 |
In this simplified game, strategy Y is still strictly dominated by strategy X for player B, since choosing X always yields a higher payoff than choosing Y, regardless of what player A does. Therefore, we can eliminate strategy Y for player B from consideration as well.
After eliminating strategy Y for both players, we are left with a single strategy profile (X,X), which is the unique Nash equilibrium of the game.
