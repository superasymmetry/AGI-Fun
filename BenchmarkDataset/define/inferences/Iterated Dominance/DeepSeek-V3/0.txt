In game theory, **iterated dominance** (also called **iterated elimination of dominated strategies**) is a method used to solve games by sequentially removing strategies that are strictly or weakly dominated for a player, simplifying the game until no further dominated strategies remain.

### Key Concepts:
1. **Dominated Strategy**:  
   - A strategy is **strictly dominated** if there exists another strategy that yields a higher payoff for a player **regardless of what the other players do**.  
   - A strategy is **weakly dominated** if another strategy does at least as well in all cases and strictly better in at least one.

2. **Process of Iterated Elimination**:  
   - **Step 1**: Identify and remove a strictly dominated strategy for any player.  
   - **Step 2**: Repeat the process for the reduced game (since removing a strategy may make other strategies dominated).  
   - Continue until no more dominated strategies exist.

3. **Result**:  
   - The remaining strategies form the **iterated dominance solution**.  
   - If only one strategy per player remains, it is a **dominance-solvable game**, and the outcome is a Nash Equilibrium.

### Example:  
Consider the following payoff matrix for two players (Row and Column):

|               | Column: L | Column: R |
|---------------|----------|----------|
| **Row: U**    | (1, 1)   | (0, 2)   |
| **Row: D**    | (2, 0)   | (1, 1)   |

- For **Row**:  
  - If Column plays **L**, Row gets 1 from **U** and 2 from **D**.  
  - If Column plays **R**, Row gets 0 from **U** and 1 from **D**.  
  → **U** is strictly dominated by **D** for Row. Eliminate **U**.

- Reduced game:  

|               | Column: L | Column: R |
|---------------|----------|----------|
| **Row: D**    | (2, 0)   | (1, 1)   |

- For **Column**:  
  - If Row plays **D**, Column gets 0 from **L** and 1 from **R**.  
  → **L** is strictly dominated by **R** for Column. Eliminate **L**.

- Final outcome: **(D, R)** with payoffs (1, 1).  

### Notes:
- **Order matters**: The sequence of elimination can affect the result if weakly dominated strategies are removed.  
- **Not all games are dominance-solvable**: Some games (e.g., Rock-Paper-Scissors) have no dominated strategies to eliminate.  
- **Relation to Nash Equilibrium**: A strategy profile surviving iterated elimination of strictly dominated strategies is a Nash Equilibrium (though not all Nash Equilibria survive this process).

This method is particularly useful for simplifying complex games and identifying rational outcomes.
