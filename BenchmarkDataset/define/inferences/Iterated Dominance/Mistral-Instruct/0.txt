 Iterated dominance, also known as repeated dominance or transitive dominance, is a concept used in game theory to determine the long-term best strategy in a repeated game. It's an extension of the dominance principle, where a strategy is said to dominate another if it always leads to a better outcome, regardless of the opponent's moves.

In iterated dominance, a strategy is compared not just to one other strategy, but to the entire strategy set. If a strategy A beats strategy B, and strategy B beats strategy C, then strategy A is said to iteratively dominate strategies B and C. This means that in a repeated game, strategy A would be the best choice because it consistently outperforms the other strategies.

However, it's important to note that iterated dominance only applies to one-shot, two-player games. In repeated games or multiplayer games, other factors like cooperation, reputation, and the possibility of defection can come into play, making the analysis more complex.

In practice, iterated dominance is used as a preliminary step in the analysis of games. Strategies that are iteratively dominated are often eliminated from further consideration, as they are not viable long-term strategies. The remaining strategies are then analyzed using other methods, such as the Nash equilibrium or evolutionarily stable strategies.
