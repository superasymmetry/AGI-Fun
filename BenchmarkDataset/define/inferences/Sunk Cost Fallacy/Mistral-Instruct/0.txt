 The sunk cost fallacy is a cognitive bias that occurs when people continue to invest time, money, or effort into a venture based on previously invested resources, rather than making decisions based solely on the potential future benefits or losses. In other words, people tend to persist in a behavior or endeavor because they have already invested a significant amount of resources into it, even if it is no longer a wise or profitable decision. This fallacy can lead to irrational and suboptimal decision-making.

An example of the sunk cost fallacy might be a person who has spent a large sum of money on a ticket to a concert, but the performer gets sick and the concert is canceled. Instead of accepting the loss and asking for a refund, the person might choose to attend a different concert, even if they are not particularly interested in the performer, because they feel they have already "sunk" so much money into the initial ticket. This decision is based on the sunk cost, rather than the potential enjoyment or value of the alternative concert.

It's important to recognize the sunk cost fallacy and make decisions based on future benefits and losses, rather than past investments. By doing so, individuals can make more rational and effective decisions that lead to better outcomes.
