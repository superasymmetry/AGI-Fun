The sunk cost fallacy is a psychological bias that occurs when individuals continue an endeavor or continue consuming or pursuing an option due to previously invested resources (such as time, money, or effort), regardless of the current costs and benefits. The fallacy is that these past investments should not influence present decisions; rather, decisions should be based solely on the potential future value. However, people often irrationally consider sunk costs when making decisions, leading them to remain committed to a course of action even when it would be more rational to change direction. This can apply to various situations, such as staying in an unproductive job, persisting with a failing project, or not cutting losses on investments.
