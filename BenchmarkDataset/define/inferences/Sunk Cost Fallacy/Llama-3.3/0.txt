The sunk cost fallacy is a psychological bias that refers to the tendency for individuals to continue investing time, money, or effort into a decision or situation because of the resources they have already committed, even if it no longer makes sense to do so. This bias leads people to prioritize their past investments over their current and future well-being.

The term "sunk cost" refers to a cost that has already been incurred and cannot be recovered. In a rational decision-making process, sunk costs should be ignored, as they are irrelevant to future decisions. However, the sunk cost fallacy causes people to feel a strong emotional attachment to their past investments, making it difficult for them to abandon a project or decision, even if it is no longer viable or beneficial.

Examples of the sunk cost fallacy include:

1. Continuing to invest in a failing business or project because of the money already spent.
2. Staying in a toxic relationship because of the time and emotional energy already invested.
3. Finishing a bad book or movie because of the time already spent on it.
4. Keeping a possession because of the money spent on it, even if it is no longer useful or needed.

The sunk cost fallacy can lead to poor decision-making, as individuals may prioritize their past investments over their current and future needs. It can also lead to a phenomenon known as "throwing good money after bad," where individuals continue to invest resources in a failing endeavor, hoping to recoup their losses or justify their past decisions.

To avoid the sunk cost fallacy, it's essential to separate past investments from future decisions and focus on the current and future benefits of a decision, rather than the resources already committed. This requires a rational and objective evaluation of the situation, unencumbered by emotional attachment to past investments.
