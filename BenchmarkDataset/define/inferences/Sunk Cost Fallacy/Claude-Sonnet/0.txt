The sunk cost fallacy is a cognitive bias where people continue investing time, money, effort, or resources into something because of past investments, even when it's no longer rational to do so. People feel compelled to continue an endeavor or behavior because of previously invested resources that cannot be recovered.

Examples include:
- Continuing to watch a bad movie because you've already spent an hour watching it
- Staying in an unfulfilling relationship because you've been together for years
- Continuing a failing project because you've already spent significant money on it
- Finishing an unenjoyable meal because you paid for it

The rational approach would be to make decisions based on future costs and benefits, ignoring past investments that cannot be recovered. The sunk cost fallacy often leads to poor decision-making and can prevent people from cutting their losses and moving on to better alternatives.

This bias is related to loss aversion and commitment escalation, where people have difficulty accepting losses and tend to increase their commitment to failing courses of action.
