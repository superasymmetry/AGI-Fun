The sunk cost fallacy is a cognitive bias that occurs when individuals continue investing in a decision, project, or course of action based on the cumulative prior investment (time, money, resources) rather than on the current and future value or viability. Essentially, people are influenced by the amount they have already invested, leading them to make irrational decisions to continue or escalate their commitment despite evidence suggesting that this is not the best course of action.

This fallacy arises from a reluctance to accept a loss, potentially due to emotional attachment, fear of waste, or a desire to justify past decisions. For example, someone might continue watching a boring movie because they've already paid for the ticket, or a company might persist with a failing project because they've already invested significant funds into it. The more constructive approach would be to base decisions purely on the expected future benefits and costs, disregarding what has already been expended.
