The sunk cost fallacy is a psychological bias that occurs when individuals continue investing in a decision based on the cumulative prior investment (time, money, resources) rather than the current and future value of continuing the investment. Essentially, people fall into the trap of considering the sunk cost — which are costs that have already been incurred and cannot be recovered — when deciding whether to continue or abandon a project or decision.

The rational decision-making process should focus on marginal costs and benefits, considering only future outcomes and not past expenditures. However, the sunk cost fallacy leads people to stick with decisions that no longer serve their best interest simply because they feel reluctant to 'waste' the prior investments. This can apply to various scenarios, such as staying in an unfulfilling job, keeping a losing investment, or persisting with a project that is unlikely to succeed.
