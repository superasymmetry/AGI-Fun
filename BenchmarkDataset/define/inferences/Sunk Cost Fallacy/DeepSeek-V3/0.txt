The **sunk cost fallacy** is a cognitive bias where individuals continue investing time, money, or effort into a decision based on the cumulative prior investment (sunk costs) rather than the current or future benefits. Essentially, people feel reluctant to abandon a failing endeavor because they don't want to "waste" what they've already put in—even when cutting losses would be the more rational choice.

### **Key Features of the Sunk Cost Fallacy:**
1. **Past Investments Override Rationality** – Decisions are influenced by irrecoverable costs rather than future outcomes.
2. **Emotional Attachment** – People feel loss aversion, regret, or guilt about abandoning an investment.
3. **Commitment Escalation** – The more invested (time, money, effort), the harder it becomes to quit.

### **Examples:**
- **Financial:** Continuing to fund a failing business because "we've already spent so much."
- **Personal:** Staying in a bad relationship because "we've been together for years."
- **Everyday Life:** Finishing a boring movie just because you paid for the ticket.

### **Why It Happens:**
- **Loss Aversion** (people hate losing more than they enjoy winning).
- **Desire for Consistency** (not wanting to admit a mistake).
- **Misplaced Optimism** ("Maybe things will turn around if I keep trying").

### **How to Avoid It:**
- Recognize sunk costs as **irrecoverable**—they shouldn’t dictate future decisions.
- Focus on **future costs and benefits** instead of past investments.
- Seek external, objective advice to counter emotional bias.

This bias is a common trap in business, relationships, and personal habits, making it important to recognize and overcome for better decision-making.
