The sunk cost fallacy is a psychological bias that occurs when individuals continue investing in a decision, project, or course of action based on the cumulative prior investment (time, money, effort) rather than current and future value or outcomes. This bias leads people to irrationally continue with a course of action because of what has already been invested, even when it would be more rational to cut their losses and move on. The fallacy lies in treating sunk costs—costs that cannot be recovered—as if they should influence decision-making, when in fact these costs should be irrelevant to current and future decisions. This bias can lead to inefficient decision-making and resource allocation.
