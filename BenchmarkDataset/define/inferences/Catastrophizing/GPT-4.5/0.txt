Catastrophizing is a cognitive distortion and psychological bias where an individual irrationally anticipates the worst possible outcome of a situation, assuming that it will be disastrous. This involves exaggerating minor setbacks or challenges, viewing them as significantly more serious or insurmountable than they actually are. People who catastrophize may escalate small problems into major crises in their mind, often leading to increased anxiety, stress, and helplessness. This bias is commonly observed in anxiety disorders and can negatively affect decision-making and problem-solving. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) techniques are often used to help individuals recognize and challenge these distorted thought patterns.
