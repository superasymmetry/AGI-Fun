**Catastrophizing** is a cognitive distortion—a type of psychological bias—where an individual assumes the worst-case scenario will happen, often exaggerating the severity or likelihood of negative outcomes. It involves turning minor problems or uncertainties into overwhelming disasters in one's mind.

### Key Features of Catastrophizing:
1. **Magnification**: Blowing a situation out of proportion (e.g., "If I fail this test, I’ll never get a job").  
2. **Minimization**: Ignoring evidence that contradicts the catastrophic prediction (e.g., dismissing past successes).  
3. **Predictive Thinking**: Believing you can foresee the future negatively (e.g., "This headache must be a brain tumor").  

### Examples:
- **Health Anxiety**: Interpreting a small ache as a sign of a fatal illness.  
- **Work/School**: Assuming one mistake will lead to total failure (e.g., "My boss will fire me over this tiny error").  
- **Relationships**: Believing a minor disagreement means the relationship is doomed.  

### Connection to Other Biases:
Catastrophizing overlaps with:  
- **Negativity Bias**: Focusing disproportionately on negative information.  
- **Overgeneralization**: Viewing a single event as a never-ending pattern of defeat.  

### Impact:
It fuels anxiety, depression, and avoidance behaviors, creating a cycle of irrational fear and stress.  

### Counteracting Catastrophizing:
- **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)**: Challenges irrational thoughts.  
- **Reality Testing**: Asking, "What evidence supports this worst-case scenario?"  
- **Mindfulness**: Staying present rather than spiraling into imagined futures.  

In short, catastrophizing is a mental habit of expecting disaster, often disconnected from actual probabilities. Recognizing it is the first step toward more balanced thinking.
