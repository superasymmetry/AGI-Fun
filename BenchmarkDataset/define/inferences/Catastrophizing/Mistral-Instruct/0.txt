 Catastrophizing is a cognitive distortion or psychological bias where an individual exaggerates the magnitude, importance, or consequences of a negative event or situation, imagining it as much worse than it actually is. This bias can lead to feelings of anxiety, fear, and hopelessness, as the person anticipates the worst possible outcome.

For example, if a person misses a deadline at work, a catastrophizer might think, "I'll lose my job, my family will be ruined, and I'll be homeless." In reality, missing a deadline might only result in a warning or a small consequence, but the catastrophizing thought process magnifies the situation beyond its actual impact.

Catastrophizing can be harmful because it can lead to excessive worry, stress, and poor decision-making. It's important for individuals to recognize this bias and work on challenging negative thoughts with more realistic and balanced perspectives. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) can be an effective tool in helping individuals manage catastrophizing thoughts and reduce their anxiety levels.
