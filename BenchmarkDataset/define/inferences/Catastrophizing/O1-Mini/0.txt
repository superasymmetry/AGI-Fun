Catastrophizing is a cognitive distortion where an individual irrationally assumes that the worst possible outcome will occur in a situation. This psychological bias leads people to anticipate and focus on disastrous consequences, often without any substantial evidence to support such extreme predictions. It can amplify stress and anxiety, as individuals may perceive challenges or obstacles as insurmountable threats. This tendency is common in various mental health conditions, such as anxiety disorders and depression, and addressing it often involves cognitive-behavioral strategies to encourage more balanced and realistic thinking.
