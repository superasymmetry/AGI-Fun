Catastrophizing is a type of cognitive distortion that involves exaggerating the potential negative outcomes of a situation. It is a common psychological bias that can lead to increased anxiety, stress, and depression. Catastrophizing can also lead to avoidance behaviors, as individuals may avoid situations that they perceive as potentially harmful or threatening.
