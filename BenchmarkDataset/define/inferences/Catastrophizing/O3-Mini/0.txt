Catastrophizing is a cognitive distortion or psychological bias where an individual irrationally predicts and assumes the worst possible outcome of a situation. People who catastrophize often blow things out of proportion, envisioning disastrous consequences from relatively minor events or challenges. This mindset can lead to increased anxiety and stress, as the person becomes overwhelmed by imagined worst-case scenarios. Catastrophizing is often associated with conditions like anxiety disorders and depression, and it can significantly impact decision-making and emotional well-being. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and other therapeutic approaches often aim to address and modify this type of thinking pattern by promoting more balanced and realistic assessments of situations.
