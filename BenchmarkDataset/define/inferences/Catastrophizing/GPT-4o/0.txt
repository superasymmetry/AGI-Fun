Catastrophizing is a cognitive distortion that leads individuals to anticipate the worst possible outcome in a situation, often blowing things out of proportion. It involves irrational thinking patterns where a person expects disaster and focuses excessively on unlikely, worst-case scenarios. This can lead to heightened anxiety and stress, as the individual perceives situations as more threatening than they actually are. Catastrophizing is commonly linked with anxiety disorders and is often addressed in cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), where individuals are guided to challenge and reframe their distorted thought patterns.
