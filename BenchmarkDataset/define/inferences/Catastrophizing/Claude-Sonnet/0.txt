Catastrophizing is a cognitive distortion or thinking pattern where someone automatically assumes the worst possible outcome in a situation and exaggerates the potential negative consequences. It involves:

Key characteristics:
1. Magnifying minor problems into major disasters
2. Expecting the worst-case scenario
3. Seeing situations as far worse than they actually are
4. Assuming negative outcomes are permanent and far-reaching

Examples:
- Thinking a minor mistake at work will lead to getting fired
- Believing a headache must be a sign of a serious illness
- Assuming a single failed test means academic failure
- Interpreting one social misstep as complete social rejection

This thinking pattern can:
- Increase anxiety and stress
- Lead to depression
- Prevent taking productive action
- Create unnecessary emotional suffering
- Impact decision-making abilities

Treatment often involves:
- Cognitive behavioral therapy
- Reality testing
- Developing balanced thinking
- Learning coping strategies
