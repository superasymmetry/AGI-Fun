Illusory superiority is a cognitive bias that causes people to overestimate their own qualities and abilities relative to others. This bias leads individuals to believe that they are better than average in various domains, such as intelligence, performance, attractiveness, and moral character. It is sometimes referred to as the "better-than-average effect" or the "above-average effect."

This bias often manifests because people tend to evaluate themselves based on their internal intentions, which are seen in a positive light, while they evaluate others based on external actions, which can be subject to more critical assessment. Illusory superiority is a common trait and can affect decision-making, self-assessment, and interpersonal relationships, as individuals may not accurately assess their own shortcomings or abilities.
