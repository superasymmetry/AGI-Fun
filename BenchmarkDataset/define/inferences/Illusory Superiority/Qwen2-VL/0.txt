Illusory superiority is a cognitive bias that causes people to overestimate their abilities and underestimate the abilities of others. It is also known as the "Lake Wobegon effect," after the fictional town in Garrison Keillor's radio show "A Prairie Home Companion," where "all the women are strong, all the men are good-looking, and all the children are above average."
