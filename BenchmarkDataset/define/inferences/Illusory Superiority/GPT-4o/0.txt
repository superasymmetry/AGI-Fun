Illusory superiority is a cognitive bias whereby individuals overestimate their own abilities, qualities, or traits compared to others. This bias leads people to believe they are better than average in various domains, such as intelligence, performance, or ethical behavior, even when evidence might suggest otherwise. It is sometimes referred to as the "better-than-average effect" and can be observed in many areas of life, from driving skills to moral reasoning. The bias is thought to stem from a combination of factors, including the need for self-esteem, lack of awareness of one's own limitations, and the tendency to focus more on one's own strengths rather than weaknesses. Illusory superiority can impact decision-making and interactions, as it can lead to overconfidence and underestimation of risks or challenges.
