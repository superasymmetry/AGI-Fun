 Illusory superiority, also known as the Lake Wobegon effect, is a cognitive bias in which individuals tend to overestimate their own abilities, qualities, and virtues while underestimating those of others. This bias is named after a fictional town in Garrison Keillor's radio series "A Prairie Home Companion," where all the children are above average.

In essence, illusory superiority leads people to believe that they are better than average in various aspects, such as intelligence, attractiveness, driving skills, or moral character. This bias can have significant implications in various areas, including self-confidence, decision-making, and interpersonal relationships. It can also contribute to overconfidence, which can lead to risky behavior and poor decision-making.
