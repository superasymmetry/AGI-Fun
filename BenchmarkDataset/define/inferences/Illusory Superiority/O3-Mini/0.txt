Illusory superiority is a cognitive bias wherein individuals overestimate their own qualities and abilities relative to others. This phenomenon is also known as the "above-average effect" or the "better-than-average effect." It causes people to view themselves as more competent, intelligent, ethical, or skilled than the average person despite evidence to the contrary.

This bias can manifest in various areas, such as driving, where most people believe they are better than average drivers, or intelligence, where individuals often rate their cognitive abilities higher than is statistically likely. Illusory superiority is thought to stem from a combination of factors, including self-enhancement motives, lack of self-awareness, and the tendency to compare oneself to an unfavorably perceived standard. It has implications for how individuals make decisions, perceive threats, and interact socially.
