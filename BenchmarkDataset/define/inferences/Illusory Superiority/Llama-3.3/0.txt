Illusory superiority, also known as the illusory superiority effect or the above-average effect, is a psychological bias that refers to the tendency for people to overestimate their own abilities, performance, and qualities relative to others. This bias leads individuals to believe they are better than average, even when they are not.

In other words, people tend to think they are more intelligent, more attractive, more competent, and more morally upright than the average person. This illusion of superiority can manifest in various aspects of life, such as academic performance, driving skills, or social behaviors.

The term "illusory" refers to the fact that this perception of superiority is often not based on objective reality. Studies have shown that when people are asked to rate themselves on various traits or abilities, the majority tend to rate themselves above average, which is statistically impossible.

Illusory superiority can have both positive and negative consequences. On the positive side, it can boost self-confidence and motivation. On the negative side, it can lead to overconfidence, poor decision-making, and a lack of self-awareness, which can ultimately hinder personal growth and relationships.

This bias was first identified by psychologists David Dunning and Justin Kruger in their 1999 study, which found that people who performed poorly on tests tended to overestimate their performance and abilities. The study also showed that people who performed well on tests tended to underestimate their performance and abilities, a phenomenon known as the "impostor syndrome."

Overall, illusory superiority is a common psychological bias that can affect anyone, and recognizing it can help individuals develop a more realistic and humble self-perception.
