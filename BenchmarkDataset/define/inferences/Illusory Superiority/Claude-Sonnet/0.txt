Illusory superiority, also known as the "above-average effect" or "superiority bias," is a cognitive bias that causes people to overestimate their own qualities and abilities relative to others. People affected by this bias tend to believe they are better than average in various domains, even when this is statistically impossible for everyone to be above average.

Key aspects of illusory superiority:

1. Common manifestations:
- Driving ability

2. Characteristics:

Awareness of this bias can help people make more realistic self-assessments and better decisions.
