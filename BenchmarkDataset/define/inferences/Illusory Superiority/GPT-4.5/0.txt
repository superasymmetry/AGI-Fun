Illusory superiority is a cognitive bias wherein individuals overestimate their own qualities, abilities, or traits in comparison to others. This bias leads people to believe that they are better than average in various domains, such as intelligence, skills, or personality traits. Illusory superiority is a common phenomenon and can affect anyone, often without conscious awareness. It is sometimes referred to as the "better-than-average effect" or "Lake Wobegon effect," where almost everyone believes they are above average, which is statistically impossible. This bias can impact decision-making, self-assessment, and social interactions, often leading individuals to overlook their limitations and overestimate their competencies.
