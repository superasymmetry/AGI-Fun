A **slant rhyme** (also called a **half rhyme**, **near rhyme**, or **imperfect rhyme**) is a type of rhyme in which the sounds are similar but not identical. Unlike a perfect rhyme, where the ending consonant and vowel sounds match exactly (e.g., *cat* and *hat*), a slant rhyme involves words with similar—but not identical—sounds.

### Characteristics of Slant Rhyme:
1. **Similar, but not exact sounds** – The words may share consonant sounds (*consonance*) or vowel sounds (*assonance*), but not both.
   - Example: *worm* and *swarm* (same ending consonant, different vowel sounds)
   - Example: *lake* and *fate* (same vowel sound, different consonants)

2. **Used for artistic effect** – Poets often use slant rhymes to create subtle, unexpected, or dissonant effects, adding complexity to their work.

3. **Common in modern poetry** – While perfect rhymes are more traditional, slant rhymes are frequently used in contemporary poetry and songwriting for a looser, more natural sound.

### Examples of Slant Rhyme:
- *Eyes* / *light* (shared vowel sound, different consonants)  
- *Come* / *home* (similar consonant endings, different vowels)  
- *Prove* / *love* (similar ending sounds but not exact)  

Slant rhymes allow poets to break from strict rhyming patterns while still maintaining a sense of rhythm and musicality. Writers like Emily Dickinson, W.B. Yeats, and modern songwriters often employ slant rhymes for expressive flexibility.
