A slant rhyme, also known as a near rhyme, half rhyme, or imperfect rhyme, is a type of rhyme where the words have similar but not identical sounds. This type of rhyme typically involves the repetition of consonant sounds (consonance) or vowel sounds (assonance) in the stressed syllables of the words, rather than a perfect match in both consonants and vowels. Slant rhymes are often used in poetry and song lyrics to create a subtle and sometimes unexpected sonic connection between words. They can also add a layer of complexity and richness to the text. For example, the words "cut" and "mat" form a slant rhyme because they have the same ending consonant sound but different vowel sounds.
