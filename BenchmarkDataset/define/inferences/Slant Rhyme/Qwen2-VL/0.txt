A slant rhyme, also known as a half rhyme or near rhyme, is a type of rhyme where the sounds of two words are similar but not identical. Specifically, the ending consonant sounds of the words are the same, but the vowel sounds are different. For example, "love" and "rove" are a slant rhyme. Slant rhymes are often used in poetry and songwriting to create a sense of rhythm and musicality without adhering strictly to perfect rhymes.
