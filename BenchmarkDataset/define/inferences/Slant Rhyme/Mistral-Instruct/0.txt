 A slant rhyme, also known as a partial rhyme or off-rhyme, is a type of rhyme where the end words sound similar but do not fully rhyme according to traditional rhyming rules. Instead, they share similar, but not identical, sounds. For example, "day" and "way" are slant rhymes because they share the "ay" sound but do not fully rhyme with each other. This type of rhyme is often used in poetry to create a more subtle and nuanced effect.
