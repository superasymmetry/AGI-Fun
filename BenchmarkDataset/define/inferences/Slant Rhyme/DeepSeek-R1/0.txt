Okay, so I need to figure out what a slant rhyme is. Let me start by recalling what I know about rhymes in general. Rhymes are when words have similar sounds, usually at the end of lines in poetry. There's perfect rhyme, like "cat" and "hat," where the ending sounds match exactly. But slant rhyme... I think that's different. Maybe it's not a perfect match.

Wait, I've heard the term "near rhyme" before. Could that be the same as slant rhyme? Maybe. Slant rhymes might be when the words almost rhyme but aren't exact. Like "moon" and "bone" or something. The vowels or consonants are similar but not the same. Let me think of another example. Maybe "hold" and "bald"? The endings are sort of similar but not identical.

I should check the definition. Slant rhyme, also called half rhyme, near rhyme, or imperfect rhyme. It's a type of rhyme where the sounds are similar but not exact. This can happen in a few ways. Maybe the consonants match but the vowels don't, or vice versa. For example, "worm" and "swarm" have the same ending consonant sounds but different vowels. That's a slant rhyme.

Another example could be "eyes" and "light." The ending consonants aren't the same, but there's a similarity in the vowel sounds. Or maybe "gone" and "on" where the vowels are the same but the consonants differ slightly. Wait, "gone" and "on" actually rhyme perfectly in some accents, but maybe in others they don't. Hmm, that might be a tricky example.

I should remember that slant rhyme is often used to create a particular effect in poetry. It can make the poem feel less predictable and more modern or conversational. Poets like Emily Dickinson used slant rhymes a lot. For instance, in her poem "Hope is the thing with feathers," she rhymes "soul" with "all." Those aren't perfect rhymes, but they have a similar 'l' sound at the end. That's a good example.

So, to sum up, slant rhyme is when words have similar but not identical sounds. It's more flexible than perfect rhyme and can add complexity or a subtle musicality to poetry. It's important to distinguish it from other types like eye rhyme (where words look like they should rhyme but don't, like "cough" and "bough") or assonance (repeating vowel sounds) and consonance (repeating consonant sounds). Slant rhyme might use elements of these but specifically refers to the near-miss in rhyming.

A **slant rhyme** (also known as a **half rhyme**, **near rhyme**, or **imperfect rhyme**) is a type of rhyme in which the sounds of words are similar but not identical. Unlike perfect rhymes (e.g., "cat" and "hat"), slant rhymes may involve:  
- Matching consonants but differing vowels (e.g., "worm" and "swarm").  
- Matching vowels but differing consonants (e.g., "hold" and "bald").  
- Subtle phonetic similarities that create a partial echo (e.g., "soul" and "all" in Emily Dickinson's poetry).  

### Key Traits:
1. **Flexibility**: Offers a less predictable, more nuanced sound compared to exact rhymes.  
2. **Purpose**: Used to evoke tension, modernity, or introspection in poetry.  
3. **Examples in Literature**: Prominent in works of poets like Emily Dickinson, W.B. Yeats, and modern songwriters.  

### Contrasts With:
- **Eye Rhyme**: Words that look similar but sound different (e.g., "love" and "move").  
- **Assonance/Consonance**: Repetition of vowel or consonant sounds without rhyming.  

Slant rhyme enriches poetic texture by balancing familiarity and surprise, making it a powerful tool for creative expression.
