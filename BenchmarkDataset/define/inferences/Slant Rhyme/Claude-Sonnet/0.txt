A slant rhyme (also called an imperfect rhyme, near rhyme, or oblique rhyme) is when two words have similar but not identical sounds, particularly in their stressed syllables. Unlike perfect rhymes (like "cat/hat" or "blue/true"), slant rhymes might share similar consonant or vowel sounds but don't match exactly. Examples include:

- breath/death
- eye/light
- heart/guard
- wild/child
- though/cuff

Slant rhymes are commonly used in poetry and song lyrics to create more flexible rhyming possibilities and can add subtle musicality to verse without being as predictable as perfect rhymes.
