A slant rhyme, also known as a near rhyme, half rhyme, or imperfect rhyme, is a type of rhyme in which the sounds of the words are similar but not identical. In slant rhymes, either the vowel sounds or the consonant sounds may be matched, but not both. This technique creates a subtler connection between the words than a perfect rhyme. For example, the words "shape" and "keep" or "moon" and "run" demonstrate slant rhyme. Slant rhymes are often used in poetry and songwriting to create a more nuanced auditory experience or to maintain a particular rhythm while avoiding predictable or clich√©d patterns.
