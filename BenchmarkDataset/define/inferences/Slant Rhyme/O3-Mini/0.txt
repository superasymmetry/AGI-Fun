A slant rhyme, also known as a near rhyme, half rhyme, or imperfect rhyme, occurs when two words share similar, but not identical sounds. In slant rhymes, either the vowels or the consonants of the stressed syllables are similar, but they do not fully rhyme. For example, the words "shape" and "keep" or "hold" and "bald" demonstrate slant rhymes. This type of rhyme is often used in poetry and music to create a sense of harmony while allowing for greater flexibility in word choice. Slant rhymes can also contribute to the mood or tone of a piece by creating a subtle discord or tension.
