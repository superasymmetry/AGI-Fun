A slant rhyme, also known as a near rhyme, half rhyme, or imperfect rhyme, is a type of rhyme in which the sounds are similar but not exactly the same. Often, slant rhymes involve consonants that are the same but vowels that are different, or vice versa. For example, words like "bridge" and "grudge" or "young" and "song" would be considered slant rhymes. Slant rhymes are commonly used in poetry and song lyrics to create a subtle rhyme that doesn't seem too forced, allowing for more flexibility and creativity with word choice and structure.
