Black and white thinking, also known as dichotomous thinking or all-or-nothing thinking, is a cognitive distortion characterized by viewing situations or outcomes in rigid, binary terms, without recognizing the nuances or complexities involved. This type of thinking reduces reality to extremes, so something is seen as either good or bad, a success or failure, with no middle ground. It often disregards the spectrum of possibilities in between.

This thinking pattern can contribute to various emotional and behavioral issues, as it limits one's ability to perceive situations realistically and respond adaptively. For instance, a person who engages in black and white thinking might see a minor mistake at work as a total failure or conclude that if they're not perfect in a task, they're a complete failure. Recognizing and addressing this cognitive distortion is often a focus in cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to promote more balanced and flexible thinking.
