**Black-and-white thinking** (also known as **dichotomous thinking**, **all-or-nothing thinking**, or **splitting**) is a cognitive distortion where a person views situations, people, or themselves in extreme, polarized terms—with no middle ground or shades of gray. 

### **Key Characteristics:**
1. **Binary Categories** – Things are seen as either *all good* or *all bad*, *perfect* or *a failure*, *right* or *wrong*, with no in-between.
   - Example: "If I'm not the best, I'm a total failure."
2. **Overgeneralization** – A single negative event is seen as a never-ending pattern.
   - Example: "I made one mistake, so I’m completely incompetent."
3. **Rigid Standards** – Unrealistic perfectionism leads to harsh self-judgment or judgment of others.
   - Example: "If my partner isn’t perfect, they must not love me."

### **Psychological Impact:**
- Increases **anxiety, depression, and frustration** (due to unrealistic expectations).
- Strains **relationships** (seeing people as either "with me or against me").
- Leads to **self-sabotage** (avoiding challenges for fear of not being perfect).

### **Common in:**
- **Perfectionism**  
- **Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD)** – Often called "splitting."  
- **Depression & Anxiety Disorders**  
- **Narcissistic Traits** – Idealizing or devaluing others.  

### **How to Counter It:**
1. **Recognize the distortion** – Ask: *"Is this really all-or-nothing, or is there a middle ground?"*  
2. **Practice "gray thinking"** – Acknowledge nuances (e.g., "I made a mistake, but I also did well in other areas.").  
3. **Challenge absolutes** – Replace *"always"* and *"never"* with *"sometimes"* or *"it depends."*  
4. **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)** – Helps reframe extreme thoughts.
