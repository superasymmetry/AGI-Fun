Black and white thinking, also known as all-or-nothing thinking or dichotomous thinking, is a cognitive distortion where an individual perceives situations, events, or outcomes in extreme terms, without acknowledging any middle ground or nuance. It involves seeing things as either completely one way or the other, such as categorizing things as good or bad, right or wrong, success or failure, with no gray area or spectrum in between.

This type of thinking can lead to overly simplistic and often unrealistic assessments of situations, making it difficult to cope with life's complexities. It can contribute to stress, anxiety, depression, and interpersonal conflicts, as individuals may have rigid expectations and may struggle to adapt when things do not fall neatly into their perceived categories. Recognizing and addressing black and white thinking can be an important step in cognitive-behavioral therapy and improving emotional resilience.
