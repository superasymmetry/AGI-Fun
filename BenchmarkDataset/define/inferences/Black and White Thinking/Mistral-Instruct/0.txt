 Black and white thinking, also known as dichotomous thinking or polarized thinking, is a cognitive bias that involves seeing things in only two distinct categories, with no shades of gray or middle ground. This type of thinking is characterized by extremes, such as "all or nothing," "good or bad," "right or wrong," or "successful or a failure."

In psychology, black and white thinking is often considered maladaptive because it can lead to over-generalizations, oversimplifications, and a lack of flexibility in problem-solving. It can also contribute to emotional distress, as individuals who engage in this type of thinking may have difficulty accepting ambiguity or dealing with complex situations that do not fit neatly into their binary categories.

Examples of black and white thinking include:

* Believing that if you make one mistake, you are a complete failure.
* Thinking that if someone disagrees with you, they must be your enemy.
* Assuming that if you don't have a perfect body, you are unattractive.
* Believing that if you don't achieve your goals immediately, you will never succeed.

Recognizing and challenging black and white thinking can help individuals develop more flexible and adaptive ways of thinking, which can lead to improved emotional well-being and better problem-solving skills. Techniques for challenging black and white thinking include:

* Identifying the thought and questioning its accuracy.
* Challenging the thought by considering alternative perspectives.
* Examining the evidence for and against the thought.
* Reframing the thought in a more balanced and flexible way.
* Practicing self-compassion and acknowledging that perfection is not attainable.
* Seeking support from others to gain a different perspective.
