Black and white thinking, also known as dichotomous or all-or-nothing thinking, is a cognitive distortion where people tend to think in absolute terms, seeing situations, people, or events as either completely good or completely bad, with no middle ground or nuance. This type of thinking often ignores the complexity of reality and the fact that most situations fall somewhere on a spectrum rather than at extreme ends.

Examples include:
- Viewing success as either perfect or total failure
- Categorizing people as either friends or enemies
- Seeing decisions as either right or wrong
- Labeling experiences as either wonderful or terrible

This thinking pattern can lead to:
1. Increased stress and anxiety
2. Poor decision-making
3. Relationship difficulties
4. Unrealistic expectations
5. Depression and other mental health issues

Recognizing and challenging black and white thinking is an important part of cognitive behavioral therapy and maintaining good mental health.
