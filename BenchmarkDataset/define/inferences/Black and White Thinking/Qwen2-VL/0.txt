Black and white thinking, also known as all-or-nothing thinking, is a type of cognitive bias in which a person sees things in absolute terms, rather than recognizing that there are shades of gray in between. This type of thinking can lead to a distorted view of reality, as it ignores the complexity and nuance of most situations. For example, a person who engages in black and white thinking might believe that they are either a complete success or a complete failure, without acknowledging the possibility of being somewhere in between.
