Black and white thinking, also known as all-or-nothing thinking or dichotomous thinking, is a cognitive distortion where a person sees situations, experiences, or people in extreme terms without recognizing any middle ground. This type of thinking categorizes everything in binary terms: good or bad, success or failure, right or wrong, with no room for nuance or complexity.

For example, someone who engages in black and white thinking might view themselves as a complete success or a total failure based on a single event or mistake, rather than considering the possibility of being generally competent but having an off day. This kind of thinking can lead to emotional distress, negatively impact decision-making, and perpetuate rigid belief systems. It is often associated with anxiety, depression, and personality disorders, such as borderline personality disorder. Recognizing and addressing this type of thinking can be a key focus in cognitive-behavioral therapy.
