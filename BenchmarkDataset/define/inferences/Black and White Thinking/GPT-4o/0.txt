Black and white thinking, also known as all-or-nothing thinking, is a cognitive distortion where an individual sees situations, events, or people in extremes, without recognizing any middle ground or complexities. This type of thinking leads people to categorize things in a binary way, such as thinking something is either entirely good or bad, a complete success or total failure, without considering any of the nuances or subtleties in between.

This kind of cognitive bias can contribute to various psychological issues, including anxiety, depression, and stress, because it can exacerbate feelings of inadequacy or hopelessness. For example, if someone believes they are either a perfect student or a complete failure after one poor grade, they may experience unnecessary distress. Overcoming black and white thinking often involves cognitive-behavioral strategies that encourage more flexible, nuanced thinking and a recognition of the gray areas inherent in most situations.
