In game theory, a zero-sum game is a type of mathematical representation used to describe situations in which one participant's gain or loss is exactly balanced by the losses or gains of the other participants. In other words, the total amount of resources or payoff is fixed, and one player's advantage must come at the expense of another. If you add up the gains and losses of all the players, the net result is zero.

Zero-sum games are often used to model competitive situations where the interests of the players are entirely opposed, such as in simple games like poker or chess. In these cases, the success of one player directly corresponds to the failure of another. The concept is fundamental in understanding competitive strategic interactions and helps to analyze optimal strategies for players in adversarial settings.
