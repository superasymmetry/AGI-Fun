 A zero-sum game is a type of mathematical game in which the total benefit to all players equals zero. In other words, any gain by one player results in a loss of an exactly equivalent amount for the other players. The term "zero-sum" comes from the fact that the sum of the payoffs for all players is zero, assuming one player's gain is considered positive, and another player's loss is considered negative.

In a zero-sum game, each player's payoff depends solely on the actions of all other players, and there is no element of chance or randomness involved. Examples of zero-sum games include poker, chess, and certain business negotiations. The concept of zero-sum games is useful in understanding strategic interactions between players, and it forms the basis for the study of game theory.
