In game theory, a zero-sum game is a situation in which one participant's gain or loss is exactly balanced by the losses or gains of other participants. In other words, the total amount of resources available is fixed, and any advantage or profit gained by one player is offset by an equivalent disadvantage or loss to one or more other players. This results in the sum of all players' payoffs being zero, hence the term "zero-sum." An example of a zero-sum game is a game of poker, where the total amount of money won by some players is equal to the total amount lost by others.
