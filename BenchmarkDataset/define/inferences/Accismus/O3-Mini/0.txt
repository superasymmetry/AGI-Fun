Accismus is a rhetorical term for a form of irony where someone pretends to not be interested in something that they actually want or desire. This pretense is often used as a form of playful denial or modesty. It's derived from the Greek word "akkismos," meaning coyness or affectation of indifference. An example of accismus might be when someone declines a gift or an offer but secretly wants to accept it.
