 Accismus is a term derived from Latin, specifically from the word "accidere," which means "to happen" or "to occur." In rhetoric, particularly in the field of medieval literature, accismus refers to a figure of speech where a person feigns indifference or even aversion to something they secretly desire. This pretense of disinterest is used to create a sense of mystery or to manipulate the emotions of others. It's a form of irony where the speaker's true feelings contradict their expressed ones.

For example, in a romantic context, a person might say they don't care about another person when, in reality, they are deeply in love. This can be used to create tension or to test the feelings of the person they are interested in. It's important to note that accismus is often considered a negative or manipulative behavior, as it involves deceiving others about one's true feelings.
