Accismus is a form of irony in which a person pretends to refuse something they actually desire. It's essentially feigned disinterest, often used to elicit a stronger offer or to appear humble. Think of it as playing hard to get, but with words.

Here's a breakdown of the key aspects:

*   **Pretended refusal:** The individual says "no" or expresses reluctance to something they really want.
*   **Underlying desire:** Beneath the surface, there's a genuine longing for the thing being refused.
*   **Purposeful deception:** The act is often deliberate, aiming to manipulate the situation in their favor (e.g., getting a better offer, appearing more modest).
*   **Irony:** The statement contradicts the true feeling, creating a sense of irony.

**Examples:**

*   Someone being offered a promotion says, "Oh, I don't know... I'm not sure I'm ready for that much responsibility," while secretly yearning for the position.
*   A shy person is being complimented on their clothing and responding, "Oh, this old thing? I just threw it on," even though they spent a lot of time and effort choosing the outfit.

**In short, accismus is a verbal coy act where someone pretends to not want something they secretly do.**
