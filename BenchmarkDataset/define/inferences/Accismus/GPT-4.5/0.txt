Accismus is a form of rhetorical irony where a person pretends to refuse something they actually desire. It's a type of feigned reluctance or insincere refusal. The term comes from the Greek word "akkismos," meaning "coyness" or "coy behavior." An example of accismus might be someone declining a piece of cake while secretly hoping someone will insist they take a slice. It's often used in literature and everyday conversation to convey a character's or person's true desires indirectly.
