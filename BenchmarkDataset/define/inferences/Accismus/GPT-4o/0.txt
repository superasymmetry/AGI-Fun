Accismus is a rhetorical term that refers to a form of feigned or pretended refusal. It is when someone pretends to show a lack of interest in something they actually want or desire. This form of irony or coyness is often used to dissimulate one's true intentions or feelings as a way to manipulate a situation or the perceptions of others. It is commonly seen in literature, drama, and everyday interactions. An example might be someone declining an offer of help or a compliment while actually wanting to accept it.
