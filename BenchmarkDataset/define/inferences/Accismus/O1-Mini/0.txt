Accismus is a rhetorical term that describes a form of irony where someone pretends to refuse something they actually desire. It's a type of feigned indifference or insincere refusal. For example, someone might act as if they are not interested in a gift or an opportunity, even though they secretly want it. This behavior can sometimes be used to appear modest or to test how much the offerer actually wants to give the item away.
