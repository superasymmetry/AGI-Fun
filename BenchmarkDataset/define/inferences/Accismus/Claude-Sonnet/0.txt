Accismus is a rhetorical device or figure of speech in which someone feigns disinterest in or rejection of something while actually desiring it. It's a form of irony where a person pretends to refuse something they genuinely want. A classic example would be someone saying "Oh, I couldn't possibly accept this award" while clearly wanting to receive it. This device is often used in literature and everyday conversation to express false modesty or coyness.
