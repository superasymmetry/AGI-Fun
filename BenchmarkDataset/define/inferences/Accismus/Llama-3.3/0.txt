Accismus is a rhetorical device in which someone pretends to refuse or decline something they actually want or are eager to accept. It involves a feigned show of reluctance or hesitation, often to avoid appearing too eager or to gain an advantage by creating a sense of modesty or humility.

In accismus, a person may say "no" or express reluctance when offered something, not because they genuinely don't want it, but because they want to appear uninterested or unenthusiastic. This can be done to:

1. Avoid appearing too eager or greedy
2. Create a sense of modesty or humility
3. Gain an advantage by making the other person persuade or convince them
4. Test the other person's sincerity or commitment

Accismus can be used in various contexts, including social interactions, business negotiations, and even literature. However, it can also be seen as a form of manipulation or insincerity, as the person is not being truthful about their intentions or desires.

Example: "Oh, no, I couldn't possibly accept that promotion. I'm not sure I'm ready for the responsibility." (When in reality, the person is eager to accept the promotion and is just pretending to be hesitant.)
