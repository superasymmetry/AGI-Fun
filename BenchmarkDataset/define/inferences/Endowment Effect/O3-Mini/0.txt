The endowment effect is a psychological bias where people ascribe more value to things merely because they own them. This means that individuals tend to demand more money to sell an object than they would be willing to pay to buy it if they did not already own it. This bias can influence decision-making and economic behavior, as the perceived value of an item is significantly influenced by ownership, rather than objective valuation or market price. The endowment effect is a well-documented phenomenon in behavioral economics and is often cited to illustrate deviations from rational decision-making as described in classical economic theory.
