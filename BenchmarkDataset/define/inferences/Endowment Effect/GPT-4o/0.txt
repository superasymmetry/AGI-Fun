The endowment effect is a cognitive bias that explains how people tend to assign more value to things simply because they own them. This phenomenon suggests that ownership increases the perceived value of an object beyond its market value or utility. As a result, individuals are often reluctant to part with their possessions, even for a fair market price, and may require a higher price to sell an item than they would be willing to pay to purchase it in the first place. The endowment effect highlights how ownership can influence decision-making and lead to irrational valuation and trading behaviors.
