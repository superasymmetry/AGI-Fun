The endowment effect is a psychological bias where people ascribe more value to things merely because they own them. It suggests that ownership increases the perceived value of an object, often beyond its objective market value. This bias can lead individuals to demand a higher price to sell an object than they would be willing to pay to acquire it. The endowment effect is commonly observed in situations where people are reluctant to part with possessions, such as in negotiations, sales of property, or even in trading scenarios, where an individual may overvalue their own goods compared to others of similar quality. This effect is thought to arise from a sense of loss aversion, where the pain of giving something up is perceived as greater than the pleasure of acquiring something new.
