The endowment effect is a cognitive bias that causes people to assign a higher value to things they own compared to things they do not own, simply because they own them. This bias suggests that ownership increases the perceived value of an item. For instance, an individual may demand more money to sell an item than they would be willing to pay for it if they did not already own it. The endowment effect is believed to arise from loss aversion, a concept from prospect theory developed by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, which suggests that people prefer to avoid losses rather than acquire equivalent gains, making losses loom larger than gains. This effect is an important consideration in behavioral economics and can significantly influence consumer behavior and decision-making processes.
