The endowment effect is a psychological bias where people place a higher value on items they own compared to identical items they don't own. In other words, people tend to demand more money to give up something they possess than they would be willing to pay to acquire the same item.

Key aspects of the endowment effect include:

1. Emotional attachment:
- People develop emotional connections to their possessions
- This attachment influences their perceived value of the item

2. Loss aversion:
- Closely related to loss aversion theory
- People feel more pain from losing something than pleasure from gaining it
- This makes them reluctant to part with their possessions

3. Examples:
- Coffee mugs experiment (Kahneman et al.)
- Trading card studies
- Real estate transactions

4. Business implications:
- Marketing strategies using trial periods
- Free samples
- Return policies
- Product ownership experiences

5. Limitations:
- Not universal across all cultures
- Can vary by individual
- May be influenced by market experience

Understanding the endowment effect is important for:
- Economic decision-making
- Marketing strategies
- Negotiation tactics
- Consumer behavior analysis
