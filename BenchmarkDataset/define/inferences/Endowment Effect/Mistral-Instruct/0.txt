 The Endowment Effect is a cognitive bias that occurs when individuals tend to overvalue things merely because they own them. This bias is often observed in situations where people demand a higher price to give up an object than they would be willing to pay to acquire it.

For example, imagine you are given a coffee mug as a gift. Due to the Endowment Effect, you might value this mug more than someone else who doesn't have it, even though the mug has no inherent value beyond its utility. This bias can lead to inefficiencies in negotiations and markets, as people may unrealistically hold onto items or demand higher prices for them.
