An enthymeme is a rhetorical device often used in arguments or persuasive communication. It is essentially a syllogism with an implied premise or conclusion. In other words, it is an argument in which one of the premises or the conclusion is not explicitly stated but is assumed by the speaker or writer and understood by the audience. This omission relies on the audience's ability to infer the missing information based on their knowledge or beliefs.

For example, in the enthymeme "Socrates is mortal because he is human," the unstated premise is "All humans are mortal." The completeness of the argument depends on the audience's ability to supply this implied premise. Enthymemes are often used in everyday conversation, advertisements, and political speeches to make arguments seem more compelling by engaging the audience in completing the logic.
