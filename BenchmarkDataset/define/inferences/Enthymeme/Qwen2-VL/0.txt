An enthymeme is a type of logical argument that is incomplete or abbreviated, in which one or more of the premises or the conclusion is left unstated. It is a common form of reasoning in everyday conversation and in persuasive writing, where the speaker or writer assumes that the audience will be able to fill in the missing premise or conclusion based on shared knowledge or common sense. Enthymemes are often used to make arguments more concise and persuasive, but they can also be misleading if the missing premise or conclusion is not actually true or if it is not obvious to the audience.
