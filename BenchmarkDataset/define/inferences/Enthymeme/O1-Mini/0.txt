An enthymeme is a rhetorical device often used in arguments and persuasive writing. It refers to an incomplete argument that relies on the audience to fill in the gaps. Essentially, an enthymeme is a syllogism in which one of the premises is implicit or assumed rather than explicitly stated.

For instance, in the statement "Socrates is mortal because he is a man," the speaker assumes the audience knows the unstated general premise that "all men are mortal." Thus, the complete syllogism would be:

1. All men are mortal. (unstated premise)
2. Socrates is a man.
3. Therefore, Socrates is mortal.

By using enthymemes, a writer or speaker can engage the audience, who becomes an active participant in the argument by supplying the missing information themselves. This makes enthymemes a powerful persuasive tool, as they can make arguments seem more convincing by aligning them with the audience's own beliefs and assumptions.
