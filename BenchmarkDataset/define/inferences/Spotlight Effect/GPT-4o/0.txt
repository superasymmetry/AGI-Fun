The spotlight effect is a psychological phenomenon where individuals tend to overestimate the extent to which their actions, appearance, and behavior are noticed by others. People often feel as though they are under a "spotlight," where their shortcomings, mistakes, or even positive traits are more visible to others than they actually are. In reality, other people are often more focused on their own lives, and pay less attention to others than might be assumed. This bias can lead to unnecessary stress and self-consciousness as individuals worry excessively about how they are perceived by those around them.
