The spotlight effect is a psychological phenomenon in which individuals tend to overestimate the extent to which their actions, appearance, or behavior are noticed and judged by others. People often believe that they are under a "spotlight" and that others are paying more attention to them than they actually are. This bias occurs because individuals are acutely aware of their own thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, which makes it difficult for them to recognize that others are much less focused on them. The spotlight effect can lead to feelings of self-consciousness and may influence decision-making and social interactions.
