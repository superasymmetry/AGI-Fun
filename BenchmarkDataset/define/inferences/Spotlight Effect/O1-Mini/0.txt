The spotlight effect is a psychological phenomenon where individuals tend to overestimate the extent to which their actions, appearance, or behaviors are noticed by others. It stems from the human predisposition to view one's own experiences as being at the center of attention, akin to a spotlight focusing on them. This bias can lead to heightened self-consciousness and the mistaken belief that others are more focused on them than they actually are. The spotlight effect illustrates the gap between our perception of being observed and the reality, where people are often more preoccupied with their own lives and less attentive to others than we might assume.
