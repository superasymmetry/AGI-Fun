 The Spotlight Effect is a cognitive bias that causes individuals to overestimate the extent to which other people notice and pay attention to their own physical appearance, actions, or mistakes, compared to how much attention they actually receive. This bias leads people to believe they are the center of attention more often than they actually are.

For example, someone might think that everyone in a room is looking at them and judging their outfit when, in reality, most people are focused on themselves or other things. This bias can lead to feelings of self-consciousness, anxiety, and embarrassment in social situations. It's important to remember that people tend to be more focused on themselves than on others, and this can help reduce the impact of the spotlight effect.
