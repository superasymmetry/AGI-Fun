The spotlight effect is a cognitive bias that occurs when people overestimate the extent to which they are being observed or judged by others. This bias can lead people to feel self-conscious or embarrassed in social situations, even when there is no reason to believe that others are paying attention to them. The spotlight effect is thought to be caused by a combination of factors, including the human tendency to focus on ourselves and our own experiences, as well as the fact that we often have limited information about what others are thinking or feeling.
