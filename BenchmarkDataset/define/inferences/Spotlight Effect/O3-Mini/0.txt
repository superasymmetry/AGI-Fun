The spotlight effect is a psychological phenomenon where individuals tend to overestimate the extent to which their actions, appearance, or behaviors are noticed by others. This cognitive bias leads people to believe that they are the focus of attention in social situations more than they actually are. The name "spotlight effect" comes from the metaphor of having a spotlight shining on oneself, highlighting one's activities to others. This effect is often driven by self-consciousness and can contribute to social anxiety, as people assume that others notice their mistakes or imperfections far more than is the case in reality. Understanding the spotlight effect can help individuals realize that others are often too preoccupied with their own lives and concerns to give much attention to the actions of others.
