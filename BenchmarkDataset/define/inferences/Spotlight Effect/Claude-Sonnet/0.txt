The spotlight effect is a cognitive bias where people tend to overestimate how much other people notice and pay attention to their appearance, actions, and behaviors. People often feel like they are in the "spotlight" and that others are paying more attention to them than they actually are.

Key aspects of the spotlight effect:

1. Self-consciousness
- People are highly aware of their own presence and actions
- They assume others are equally focused on them
- This can lead to increased anxiety in social situations

2. Common examples:
- Worrying about a small stain on clothing
- Being self-conscious about a bad hair day
- Feeling embarrassed about a minor social faux pas

3. Reality vs. Perception:
- Most people are focused on their own thoughts and behaviors
- Others typically notice far less than we think they do
- The effect stems from our self-centered perspective

4. Impact:
- Can cause social anxiety
- May lead to overthinking social situations
- Can affect self-confidence and behavior

Understanding the spotlight effect can help people:
- Reduce social anxiety
- Put minor embarrassments in perspective
- Focus less on self-consciousness
- Interact more naturally in social situations
