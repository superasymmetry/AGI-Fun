The **spotlight effect** is a cognitive bias where individuals tend to overestimate how much others notice, judge, or remember their appearance, behavior, or mistakes. Essentially, people believe they are in the "spotlight" more than they actually are, leading to self-consciousness or social anxiety.

### **Key Aspects of the Spotlight Effect:**
1. **Overestimation of Attention** – People assume others are paying far more attention to them than they really are.
2. **Self-Centered Bias** – We are naturally more focused on ourselves, which makes us project our self-awareness onto others.
3. **Impact on Behavior** – This bias can lead to excessive worry about minor flaws (e.g., a stain on a shirt, a stumble while speaking) that others barely notice.
4. **Relation to Social Anxiety** – The spotlight effect is linked to social anxiety, as individuals fear negative evaluation based on exaggerated self-perceptions.

### **Example:**
- If you wear a new outfit and feel like everyone is staring at you (positively or negatively), in reality, most people are preoccupied with their own concerns and barely notice.

### **Research & Mitigation:**
- Studies (e.g., by Thomas Gilovich) show that people consistently overestimate how much others observe them.
- To reduce the spotlight effect, remind yourself that others are less focused on you than you think ("you are your own harshest critic").

This bias is closely related to the **illusion of transparency** (overestimating how easily others can discern your internal thoughts or emotions). Both stem from our tendency to anchor judgments on our own experiences.
