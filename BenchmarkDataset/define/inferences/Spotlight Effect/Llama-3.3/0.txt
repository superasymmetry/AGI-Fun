The spotlight effect is a psychological bias that refers to the tendency for people to overestimate the extent to which others notice and pay attention to their appearance, behavior, or actions. This bias leads individuals to believe that they are the center of attention, and that others are constantly observing and judging them.

In reality, however, others are often more focused on their own thoughts, feelings, and experiences, and may not be paying as much attention to the individual as they think. The spotlight effect can lead to increased self-consciousness, anxiety, and stress, as people may feel like they are "on stage" and being constantly evaluated by others.

The term "spotlight effect" was coined by psychologists Tom Gilovich, Victoria Husted Medvec, and Kenneth Savitsky in 2000. They found that people tend to overestimate the extent to which others notice and remember their mistakes, awkward moments, or embarrassing experiences. This bias can be particularly pronounced in social situations, where people may feel like they are being scrutinized by others.

For example, if someone spills coffee on their shirt, they may feel like everyone in the room is staring at them and noticing their mistake. However, in reality, most people are probably too caught up in their own conversations and thoughts to even notice the spill.

Overall, the spotlight effect is a common psychological bias that can lead to increased self-consciousness and anxiety. By recognizing this bias, individuals can work to develop a more realistic understanding of how others perceive them, and reduce their feelings of self-consciousness and stress.
