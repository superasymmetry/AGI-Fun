Normalcy bias, also known as normality bias, is a psychological phenomenon where people underestimate the likelihood of a disaster or an unusual event occurring, and overestimate the likelihood that things will continue as they have in the past. This bias leads individuals to believe that since a catastrophic event has not occurred before, it is unlikely to happen in the future.

As a result, people with a normalcy bias tend to:

1. Downplay the risks and consequences of a potential disaster.
2. Fail to prepare for or respond to emergency situations.
3. Assume that authorities or others will take care of the situation.
4. Believe that the event will not happen to them, or that they will be able to cope with it if it does.

The normalcy bias can be observed in various situations, such as:

* Natural disasters: People may not evacuate or prepare for a hurricane or earthquake, believing that it won't be as severe as predicted.
* Financial crises: Investors may not diversify their portfolios or prepare for a market downturn, assuming that the economy will continue to grow.
* Personal safety: Individuals may not take precautions to protect themselves from potential threats, such as not having a emergency plan or not learning self-defense techniques.

The normalcy bias can have serious consequences, as it can lead to a lack of preparedness and a delayed response to emergency situations. It's essential to be aware of this bias and take steps to mitigate its effects, such as staying informed, having a plan, and being prepared for unexpected events.
