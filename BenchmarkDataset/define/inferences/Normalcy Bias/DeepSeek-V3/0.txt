**Normalcy bias** is a cognitive bias that leads individuals to underestimate the likelihood or impact of a disaster or crisis, assuming that things will continue to function normally despite warning signs or evidence to the contrary.  

### **Key Characteristics of Normalcy Bias:**  
1. **Underestimation of Risk** – People dismiss threats because they believe "everything will be fine" based on past experiences.  
2. **Denial or Minimization** – Even when faced with clear dangers, individuals may rationalize them away ("It won’t happen to me").  
3. **Delayed Response** – Because they expect normal conditions to persist, people may hesitate to take preventive or emergency actions.  
4. **Overreliance on Routine** – The brain prefers familiar patterns, making it difficult to accept abrupt changes.  

### **Examples of Normalcy Bias:**  
- Ignoring evacuation orders during a hurricane because "storms never hit us badly."  
- Failing to prepare for financial crises because "the economy always recovers."  
- Underreacting to early pandemic warnings because "it’s just like the flu."  

### **Why It Happens:**  
- The brain seeks to reduce anxiety by clinging to familiar scenarios.  
- People often assume that if something hasn’t happened before, it won’t happen now.  
- Social proof plays a role—if others aren’t reacting, individuals may follow suit.  

### **Overcoming Normalcy Bias:**  
- **Awareness** – Recognizing the bias helps in taking threats seriously.  
- **Preparedness** – Having contingency plans reduces denial.  
- **Seeking Diverse Information** – Avoiding echo chambers that reinforce complacency.  

Normalcy bias can be dangerous in emergencies, making proactive planning and critical thinking essential. Would you like examples of how this bias manifests in specific scenarios?
