Normalcy bias is a cognitive bias that causes people to underestimate the likelihood of a disaster or other negative event occurring. It is the tendency to assume that things will continue to be normal and that the future will be similar to the present. This bias can lead people to ignore warning signs and fail to take appropriate action to prepare for or respond to a disaster.
