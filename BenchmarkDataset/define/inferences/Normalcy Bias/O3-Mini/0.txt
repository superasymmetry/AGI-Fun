Normalcy bias is a cognitive bias that leads people to underestimate the likelihood or potential impact of a disaster or unusual event. It causes individuals to assume that since something has not happened before, it will not happen in the future, or that things will continue to function as they always have. This bias can result in a lack of preparedness for emergencies or a delay in taking appropriate action when facing an imminent threat. For example, individuals with normalcy bias might fail to evacuate before a natural disaster because they believe that everything will remain normal or that the situation isnâ€™t as serious as it actually is.
