Normalcy bias is a cognitive bias that leads people to underestimate the likelihood or potential impact of a disaster or unexpected event. Individuals with this bias tend to believe that things will continue to function as they have in the past, which can cause them to downplay warnings and fail to adequately prepare for emergencies. This bias often results in a delay or failure to take necessary action in the face of impending danger, as people assume that because something has not happened before, it is unlikely to happen in the future.
