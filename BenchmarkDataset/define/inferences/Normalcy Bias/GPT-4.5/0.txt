Normalcy bias is a cognitive bias that leads people to underestimate the likelihood and potential impact of a disaster or catastrophic event. Individuals with this bias tend to assume that things will continue to function as they have in the past, leading them to downplay warnings and fail to prepare adequately for emergencies. This bias can result in a failure to evacuate in the face of a natural disaster, neglecting to purchase insurance, or ignoring emergency preparedness measures. Normalcy bias can hinder effective decision-making and response in situations where quick and decisive action is necessary, as people may not be willing or able to acknowledge the severity of the situation.
