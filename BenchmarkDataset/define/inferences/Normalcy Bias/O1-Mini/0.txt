Normalcy bias is a cognitive bias that leads people to underestimate the likelihood or impact of a disaster or major disruption. Individuals with this bias tend to assume that things will continue to function as they always have, and as a result, they may underreact or fail to prepare adequately for emergencies or catastrophic events. This bias can manifest in delays in taking precautionary actions, ignoring warning signs, and an overall reluctance to change one's behavior in response to potential threats. Normalcy bias can occur in both individuals and groups, often leading to insufficient disaster preparedness and response efforts.
