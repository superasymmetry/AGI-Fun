 Normalcy bias, also known as "normality bias" or "planning fallacy," is a psychological phenomenon where people find it deeply hard to prepare for a disaster or emergency because they find it highly unlikely that it will happen to them. Instead, they rely on a false assumption of "normalcy" and expect things to continue as they always have.

This bias can lead individuals and communities to underestimate the risks of an adverse event, and fail to take appropriate precautions or make necessary preparations. As a result, when the disaster does occur, they may be caught off guard and struggle to respond effectively.

Normalcy bias can be particularly dangerous in situations where there is a real threat, such as natural disasters, economic crises, or pandemics. It can lead people to ignore warnings, refuse to evacuate, or downplay the severity of the situation, all of which can have serious consequences.

To overcome normalcy bias, it is important to be aware of it and actively work to challenge our assumptions about what is likely to happen. This can involve researching potential risks, making emergency plans, and taking steps to prepare for unexpected events. By doing so, we can increase our resilience and improve our chances of coping effectively in the face of adversity.
