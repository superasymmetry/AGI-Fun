Normalcy bias is a psychological state that causes people to underestimate both the likelihood of a disaster occurring and its possible effects. This cognitive bias leads people to believe that things will continue to function as they normally have and causes them to minimize the probability of a potential disaster, even when faced with clear warnings or evidence.

Key aspects of normalcy bias include:

1. Underestimation of risk
- Downplaying potential threats
- Assuming "it won't happen here/to me"
- Believing things will remain normal

2. Delayed response
- Slower reaction to warnings
- Reluctance to change routines
- Hesitation in taking protective actions

3. Common examples
- Ignoring evacuation orders during natural disasters
- Dismissing financial crisis warnings
- Minimizing health risks during pandemics

4. Impact on decision-making
- Can lead to poor preparation
- May result in delayed emergency response
- Could increase vulnerability to threats

Understanding normalcy bias is important for:
- Emergency preparedness
- Risk assessment
- Disaster response planning
- Personal safety
