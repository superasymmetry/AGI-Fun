In game theory, a best response is a strategy that yields the highest payoff for a player, given the strategies chosen by the other players in the game. In other words, a best response is the optimal action a player can take in response to the strategies or actions chosen by the other players.

Formally, if we consider a game with multiple players, where each player can choose from a set of strategies, a best response for a particular player is the strategy that maximizes that player's payoff, assuming the strategies of the other players are fixed.

The concept of a best response is crucial in understanding strategic interactions and forms the basis for defining important solution concepts like Nash Equilibrium. A Nash Equilibrium occurs when each player's strategy is a best response to the strategies chosen by the other players, meaning no player has an incentive to unilaterally change their strategy since doing so would not increase their payoff.
