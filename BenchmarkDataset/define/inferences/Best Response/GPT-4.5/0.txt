In game theory, a best response is a strategy or action chosen by a player that yields the highest payoff given the strategies or actions chosen by other players in the game. Essentially, it is the optimal decision a player can make, taking into account the decisions of others.

To put it another way, a player's best response is the choice that maximizes their utility, assuming the strategies of all other players are fixed. A best response can depend on many factors, including the specific strategies chosen by opponents and the structure of the payoffs in the game.

When analyzing games, especially in strategic form, finding the best response for each player can help identify equilibria, such as Nash Equilibrium, where each player's strategy is a best response to the strategies chosen by others. At a Nash Equilibrium, no player has an incentive to unilaterally deviate from their strategy, as doing so would not lead to a better payoff.
