In game theory, a best response is a strategy or set of strategies that yields the highest payoff for a player, given the strategies chosen by the other players in the game. Essentially, it is the optimal choice a player can make in response to the strategies selected by their opponents.

The concept of a best response is crucial in the analysis of Nash equilibria. A Nash equilibrium occurs when each player's strategy is the best response to the strategies chosen by everyone else, meaning no player has an incentive to unilaterally deviate from their current strategy because doing so would not result in a higher payoff.

Identifying best responses involves analyzing the payoff matrix of the game and determining what choice gives a player the maximum payoff given the other players' actions.
