The IKEA effect is a cognitive bias that causes people to place a disproportionately high value on products they partially create or assemble themselves. This phenomenon is named after the Swedish furniture retailer IKEA, known for selling furniture that requires assembly by the customer. The effect suggests that when individuals invest effort into building or completing something, they develop an emotional attachment to it and perceive it as more valuable than if they hadn't contributed to the creation process. This bias highlights how labor, effort, and personal involvement can enhance perceived value.
