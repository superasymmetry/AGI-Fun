The IKEA effect is a cognitive bias that influences how people perceive the value of products or projects they contribute effort to create or assemble. Specifically, individuals tend to assign higher value to items they have partially created themselves, compared to objects they have not had a hand in assembling or crafting. This phenomenon is named after the furniture retailer IKEA, which sells products that often require customer assembly.

The bias suggests that the effort invested in the construction of an object increases its perceived value to the builder, enhancing their attachment and satisfaction with the end product. This effect can be attributed to the combination of effort justification and the sense of accomplishment that comes from completing a task, leading individuals to view their self-made items as more valuable and meaningful than similar items created by others.
