The IKEA effect is a psychological bias that refers to the tendency for people to overvalue and become overly attached to things they have partially created or assembled themselves, such as furniture from IKEA. This phenomenon was first identified by Michael I. Norton, Daniel Mochon, and Dan Ariely in a 2011 study.

The IKEA effect suggests that when individuals invest their own time and effort into creating or assembling something, they tend to perceive it as more valuable and of higher quality than if they had simply purchased it pre-assembled. This bias is thought to occur because the process of creation or assembly increases the sense of ownership and personal connection to the object, leading to an inflated perception of its value.

The IKEA effect has implications for various aspects of consumer behavior, such as product design, marketing, and customer satisfaction. It also highlights the importance of considering the psychological factors that influence our perceptions and decisions, rather than just focusing on the objective characteristics of a product.

In everyday life, the IKEA effect can manifest in various ways, such as:

* Overestimating the quality of a DIY project
* Being more proud of a self-assembled piece of furniture
* Perceiving a self-made meal as more delicious than a pre-prepared one
* Overvaluing a self-created work of art or craft

Overall, the IKEA effect is a fascinating example of how our psychological biases can influence our perceptions and behaviors, and how the process of creation and assembly can shape our attitudes towards the things we own and use.
