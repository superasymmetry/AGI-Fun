The IKEA effect is a cognitive bias that occurs when people place a disproportionately high value on products they partially created. Named after the Swedish furniture company IKEA, this effect suggests that when individuals assemble their own products, they tend to value them more than comparable products they did not create themselves. The effort and personal investment involved in the construction process contribute to the increased perceived worth of the item. This bias highlights how effort and labor can enhance people's attachment to and valuation of a product.
