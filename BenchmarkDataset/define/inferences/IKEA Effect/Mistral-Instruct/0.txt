 The IKEA effect is a cognitive bias that describes people's tendency to overvalue items they partially assembled themselves, such as furniture from IKEA. This bias stems from the pride and satisfaction people feel when they invest their time, effort, and energy into creating something, even if the final product may not be perfect or professionally made.

The IKEA effect can lead individuals to attribute more skill and ability to themselves than may actually be present, and it can also influence their perception of the item's value. This bias can have implications in various areas, such as consumer behavior, self-esteem, and motivation. For example, a person might be more likely to keep an IKEA bookshelf they assembled themselves, even if it has minor flaws, because of the IKEA effect.
