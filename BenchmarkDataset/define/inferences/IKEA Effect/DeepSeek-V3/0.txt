The **IKEA effect** is a cognitive bias in which people place a disproportionately high value on products or creations they have partially assembled or built themselves, even if the end result is of mediocre quality.  

### Key Aspects of the IKEA Effect:
1. **Origin**: Named after IKEA, the furniture retailer, where customers often assemble their own furniture, leading to a greater sense of ownership and valuation.
2. **Psychological Mechanism**:  
   - **Effort Justification**: People rationalize their effort by valuing the outcome more.  
   - **Sense of Ownership**: Personal involvement increases emotional attachment.  
   - **Self-Enhancement**: Completing a task boosts confidence and perceived competence.  
3. **Implications**:  
   - **Marketing**: Companies leverage DIY aspects to enhance customer satisfaction (e.g., build-your-own products).  
   - **Product Design**: Encourages user customization (e.g., Nike ID, DIY meal kits).  
   - **Behavioral Economics**: Explains why people overvalue their own creations (e.g., homemade crafts, startups).  
4. **Potential Downsides**:  
   - Overvaluation can lead to poor decision-making (e.g., holding onto flawed self-made products).  
   - May cause resistance to expert improvements ("Not Invented Here" syndrome).  

### Example:  
A person who assembles a wobbly IKEA bookshelf might value it more than a sturdier, pre-assembled shelf from another store, simply because they put in the effort to build it.  

The IKEA effect highlights how **labor increases love**, influencing both consumer behavior and personal biases.
