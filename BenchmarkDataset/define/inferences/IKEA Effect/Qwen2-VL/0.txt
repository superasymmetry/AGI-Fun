The IKEA effect is a cognitive bias that leads people to place a higher value on products or services that they have put effort into creating or assembling themselves. This bias was first described in a 2011 study by Harvard Business School researchers Michael Norton, Daniel Mochon, and Sheena Iyengar. The researchers found that people who had put effort into assembling a piece of furniture, such as an IKEA shelf, were willing to pay significantly more for it than those who had not. The IKEA effect can be seen in a variety of contexts, such as DIY projects, cooking, and even relationships.
