The IKEA effect is a psychological phenomenon where people place a disproportionately high value on products they have partially created or assembled themselves. This term was coined by researchers who observed that when individuals invest effort into assembling a product, such as furniture from IKEA, they tend to overvalue the finished product compared to similar or even superior items that they did not personally build. The effect suggests that labor leads to love; the effort put into a task increases the personal value and emotional attachment to the outcome. The IKEA effect highlights how effort and personal involvement can enhance perceived value and satisfaction.
