The IKEA effect is a cognitive bias where people place a disproportionately high value on products they partially created or assembled themselves, regardless of the quality of the end result. The name comes from the Swedish furniture retailer IKEA, known for selling furniture that requires customer assembly.

Key aspects of the IKEA effect include:

1. Labor leads to love:
- People develop an emotional attachment to things they create
- The effort invested creates a sense of accomplishment
- Personal involvement increases perceived value

2. Applications:
- DIY projects
- Build-your-own products
- Customization options
- Marketing strategies

3. Psychological factors:
- Sense of competence
- Pride of authorship
- Enhanced emotional connection
- Feeling of accomplishment

The effect explains why people often value their own creations more highly than identical pre-made items, even if the quality is objectively the same or lower.
