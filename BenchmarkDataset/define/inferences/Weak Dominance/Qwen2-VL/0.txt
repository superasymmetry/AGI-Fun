In game theory, weak dominance refers to a situation where one strategy is at least as good as another strategy for a player, regardless of the strategies chosen by the other players. In other words, a strategy is weakly dominant if it provides the same or better outcome for a player in every possible scenario compared to another strategy.
For example, consider a game with two players, A and B, each with two strategies, X and Y. If strategy X for player A provides the same or better outcome than strategy Y for player A, regardless of what strategy player B chooses, then strategy X is weakly dominant for player A.
Weak dominance is an important concept in game theory because it can help players identify strategies that are unlikely to be chosen by rational opponents. If a strategy is weakly dominated, it is unlikely to be chosen by a rational player because there is always another strategy that provides at least as good an outcome. Therefore, players can often eliminate weakly dominated strategies from consideration when making their decisions.
