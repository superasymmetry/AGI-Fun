In game theory, a strategy is said to **weakly dominate** another strategy if it yields a payoff that is **at least as good** in all possible scenarios and **strictly better** in at least one scenario. 

### Formal Definition:
Let’s consider a player in a game with two strategies, \( S_1 \) and \( S_2 \).  
- \( S_1 \) **weakly dominates** \( S_2 \) if:  
  1. For **every** possible strategy profile of the other players, the payoff from \( S_1 \) is **≥** the payoff from \( S_2 \).  
  2. For **at least one** strategy profile of the other players, the payoff from \( S_1 \) is **strictly >** the payoff from \( S_2 \).  

### Key Differences from Strict Dominance:
- **Strict dominance**: \( S_1 \) always gives a **strictly better** payoff than \( S_2 \), no matter what others do.  
- **Weak dominance**: \( S_1 \) is **never worse** than \( S_2 \) and is **sometimes better**.  

### Example:
Consider the following payoff matrix for Player 1 (rows) against Player 2 (columns):

|               | Player 2: L | Player 2: R |
|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Player 1: U** | (3, _)      | (2, _)      |
| **Player 1: D** | (3, _)      | (4, _)      |

Here:  
- **U weakly dominates D** because:  
  - Against L: \( 3 \geq 3 \) (equal).  
  - Against R: \( 2 < 4 \) (D is better).  
  → D does **not** weakly dominate U.  
- However, **D does not strictly dominate U** because U is just as good when Player 2 chooses L.  

### Implications:
- A weakly dominated strategy is never a **unique best response**, but it may still be played in equilibrium if it is tied for best in some cases.  
- Rational players often eliminate strictly dominated strategies first, but weakly dominated ones may persist (e.g., in some Nash equilibria).  

### Contrast with Strict Dominance:
- **Strict dominance**: Eliminating strictly dominated strategies is uncontroversial.  
- **Weak dominance**: Elimination can sometimes remove plausible equilibria, so caution is needed.
