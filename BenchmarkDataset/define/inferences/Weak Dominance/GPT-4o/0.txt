In game theory, weak dominance refers to a situation where one strategy is at least as good as another strategy for a player, no matter what the other players choose, and there is at least one scenario where it is strictly better. Formally, a strategy \(A\) weakly dominates another strategy \(B\) if:

1. For every possible strategy combination of the other players, the payoff from choosing \(A\) is at least as high as the payoff from choosing \(B\).
2. There is at least one strategy combination of the other players that makes the payoff from \(A\) strictly higher than the payoff from \(B\).

In simpler terms, a weakly dominant strategy is never worse and sometimes better than another strategy. This concept contrasts with strict dominance, where a strategy is always better than another, regardless of what strategies other players choose. Weak dominance can be useful in refining the set of strategies to consider in a game, though it does not necessarily lead to a unique solution as strict dominance sometimes does.
