In game theory, weak dominance refers to a situation regarding strategies in a strategic game. A strategy is weakly dominant if, for a player, choosing this strategy always yields results that are at least as good as choosing any other strategy, no matter what the other players do, and there is at least one situation where it yields a strictly better outcome than another strategy.

Formally, a strategy \( s_i \) for a player \( i \) weakly dominates another strategy \( t_i \) if, for every possible set of strategies chosen by the other players, the payoff from \( s_i \) is at least equal to the payoff from \( t_i \), and there is at least one set of strategies for the other players where the payoff from \( s_i \) is strictly greater than that from \( t_i \).

It is important not to confuse weak dominance with strict dominance. In strict dominance, the strategy yields better outcomes in all circumstances, while in weak dominance, the outcomes are only guaranteed to be at least as good in all circumstances, and strictly better in some. The concept of weak dominance can be used to refine potential equilibria in games by iteratively removing weakly dominated strategies, but unlike strict dominance, this process does not always lead to a unique solution.
