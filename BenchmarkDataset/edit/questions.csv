 Alex and Laura are deciding whether or not to study for the upcoming final exam. The class is graded on a curve, and only relative performance matters, and they are the only two students in the class. For both Alex and Laura, studying leads to a raw score of 95/100, not studying leads to a raw score of 50/100. The passing grade in the class is set to be 5 percentage points below the average score in the class. Alex has no intrinsic motivation to learn and derives +1 utility from passing and 0 utility from not passing. Laura loves to learn and doesn’t care about grades, she gets +1 utility from studying and 0 utility from not studying. Laura doesn’t study, in response to Alex not studying."

 Bob is working with Sally on a co-authored paper to be submitted to the Economics and Computation (EC) conference. Bob is tasked with writing an introduction, and Sally with writing a conclusion. Both Bob and Sally have two options: they can either write their sections targeting a computer science audience, or targeting an economics audience. They have an imminent deadline, and whatever they write will need to be submitted to EC without any further changes. If one person writes for a computer science audience and another writes for an economics audience, then both players will have a payoff of 0, because the EC reviewer will be confused about the paper’s audience and therefore reject the paper. If both write for a computer science audience, then Bob will have a payoff of +2 (he is a computer scientist) while Sally only has a payoff of +1 (she is an economist). If both write for an economics audience, then Bob will have a payoff of +1 while Sally gets a payoff of +2.

 Bob is working with Sally on a co-authored paper to be submitted to the Economics and Computation (EC) conference. Bob is tasked with writing an introduction, and Sally with writing a conclusion. Both Bob and Sally have two options: they can either write their sections targeting a computer science audience, or targeting an economics audience. They have an imminent deadline, and whatever they write will need to be submitted to EC without any further changes. If one person writes for a computer science audience and another writes for an economics audience, then both players will have a payoff of 0, because the EC reviewer will be confused about the paper’s audience and therefore reject the paper. If both write for a computer science audience, then Bob will have a payoff of +2 (he is a computer scientist) while Sally only has a payoff of +1 (she is an economist). If both write for an economics audience, then Bob will have a payoff of +1 while Sally gets a payoff of +2.

 I (39M), love giving gifts, I really enjoy putting thought and consideration into gifts for siblings, in-laws, nieces/nephews, and coworkers. For me, giving gifts isn’t about the price tag, it’s about showing the other person positive regard.

This evening, I visited my mother’s home for the family holiday (siblings, mother, in-laws, nieces/nephews). Just a sample of what I brought for people: stained glass window art, handmade porcelain bowls, and handmade silver jewelry.

I wasn’t expecting much tbh, I honestly do enjoy giving gifts, but if I had received no gifts, I’d have been fine with that. While I do enjoy receiving gifts, it isn’t a quid pro quo situation.

But these fricking family members did something worse. Like, a Starbucks gift card and a hot chocolate gift basket. The kind of presents that say “I put zero time/effort into this.” At best, I can bring these things to an office party or something like that.

When I noticed the incongruence, I just started feeling like a complete fool. As soon as I could slip away, I drove home. I didn’t flip out or say anything dumb, but I feel like I was being laughed at, the butt of some joke.

Now I’m home, just feel shitty and frustrated.

If someone reading this post has an alternative narrative that I can use, I’d love to hear it.

Thanks.

 I (F21) and my boyfriend (M23) of five years went to my favorite restaurant a few weeks ago. The meal was great and we both really enjoyed ourselves. It was perfect, a completely perfect dinner. I paid the $60 check and we went out to the parking lot to the car. I live in a huge college town along with that Saturday night being a senior ball so the town was busy.

We get back to the car and the cars surrounding it was parked exactly the same as they were when we went in. There were cars to each side of his car along with a truck parallel parked behind him at least two car lengths away. In front of him was the wall of the restaurant and behind him was the roadway in the parking lot then the parallel parked truck at a distance to clarify.

He starts to back out of the space and after a few tries he says he can’t do it. I say instantly I can spot him so he can get out. He says no and that it won’t help him because the truck behind him wasn’t there when he pulled into the spot and he was scared of hitting it. (It was there when he pulled into the spot.) He also added he doesn’t want others to see me spotting him like he can’t handle his vehicle. I say okay, I’ll go into the restaurant and find the owner of one of the car and ask if there was any way they would move so he could get out, didn’t want to but it was the only choice. He says no and kinda flips his shit (throwing his hat and sunglasses into the dash in frustration and also flooring it as if he’s going to hit the building then slamming on the break before he does so.) He calls his parents screaming about not being able to get out of the spot and even locked my door when I tried to get out of the vehicle to go get someone else to help/spot him.

Also when he is on the phone the owner of one of the neighboring cars comes outside. I try to tell him that we talk to her but he ignored me and kept complaining to his parents how there was no way we were getting out of the spot. The owner of the neighboring car gets in another car and leaves while my boyfriend gets off the phone and says: “guess we’re stuck.”

The screaming and me begging him to just let me spot him continues for 20 minutes and he makes a few jabs that I don’t have a license so I wouldn’t understand how he feels. At that point I was really upset and in tears. I had just taken him out to dinner and spent a pretty good amount of money for him to show his ass? Finally he lets me out of the car to spot him and within 2 minutes we are out of the spot.

Later that night I told him that he ruined the night and the dinner I paid for for absolutely no reason. I also added that he always has to find away to destroy any date or thing in general I want to do just because it’s not something he picks. He said that what happened was my fault because I should’ve have not spoken to him because it made him more frustrated when he was trying to find a “solution to the problem.” AITA here?"

 On Mother’s Day I got and treated my mom to some of her favorite things and places while we spent the whole day together. I went to church with her along with the Mother’s Day Brunch. I also took her shopping and to her favorite expensive restaurant for dinner. In between stops, I gifted her a card, her favorite candies, favorite flowers, and a $200 gc to her favorite spa.

Sometime during the day, I posted on Facebook with a gif photo of an animated mother hugging her child that said “Happy Mother’s Day to all Moms. We love and appreciate everything you do.” I also wrote a paragraph about how thankful and grateful I am for my own mother and I wouldn’t be who I am without her.

About an hour after I get home from dinner, my mom texts me that she didn’t see her Facebook post from me. I told her that I did post to Facebook about Mother’s Day. She then says that she wants her own Facebook post and that if I don’t do it, she must not mean all that much to me. When she texted that I was taken aback. I responded are you serious? I took you out and treated you all day and gave you gifts all day, but none of that matters because of a Facebook post. I called her ungrateful and said we’re going to have another “time out” period. Since then she’s been calling everyone about how disrespectful of a daughter I am. Even my dad is trying to tell me that it’s okay for her to be upset and that I should just get over and excuse it because of what all shes done for me in the past.

Side note: I have had several time out periods with my mother. My mother had the tendency to say something rude or a dig at a person, but when she’s called out on it, she will play like she doesn’t remember what she said. Or will use tears to make it seem like you’re being mean to her."

 So my partner has always struggled with words and don’t have a way with words. He’s always said he admired my way with words. I studied literature and poetry. I’ve always tried to introduce him to the literature and poetry and tried to find ones I thought he would like. He still struggles but I never mind, I have only showed him those things for his enjoyment not to change him. To me they way is speaks is simply how she speaks. Recently he has discovered chat GBT and uses it to help with some things that need to sound more put together like resumes or letters to a boss (I used to help him with these). However yesterday when I got my birthday card I could tell most of it was ai generated. There was only one bit at the end that included a line that we say to each other that I knew was him. I don’t know how to feel. I’m sad that the card didn’t feel genuine or real. I felt like there was no effort into me. I wouldn’t have minded if it was completely all over the place with no proper grammar if it was from the heart. But it was a long heartfelt whole card long thing that I know was from chat GBT. He wasn’t home to see me open the card and I’m relieved because he was so excited for me to read it and now I feel like it’s because he was hoping I would think he improved but my face would have said it all. AIO. I feel like the reason he used it was to try and make me happy and maybe I should take that and appreciate it at the same time I would’ve preferred something that came from him."

He has a brother, whose wife is anything BUT incompetent. She works as an event organiser so she took on the task of organising the funeral book. I offered to organise the music, and slideshow. When giving my number to the Funeral director, I went blank and forgot it, looking quite foolish.

The following week, I sent a message to the WhatsApp chat that I hadn't checked and was full of spelling mistakes. I also missed the autocorrect that changed ""slideshow"" into ""sideshow"". However the service was beautiful and went off without an issue.

A couple of weeks later, my husband was angry because we were having issues starting my daughter's car. I was unable to start it causing more issues (battery) and he screamed about bring surrounded by ""f***ing incompetent"" people. When I asked if meant me, he ranted about my issues during the funeral planning.

I was upset at being spoken to that way and let him know it. He said sorry and put it down to stress and grief. This was two weeks ago. Last night he called me incompetent again because I had to get a password reset to access my work personnel file (it's a website that we hardly ever use, I may login once a year).

While all this does make me sound like a complete idiot, it should be said that we have 3 kids, and i take on most of the responsibilities for the household (except the bills). Out daughter are now grown, but when they were younger he travelled a lot and I was on my own for weeks at a time.

I am also good at my job, and have been given more responsibilities in the last year including being made a mentor to other employees.

However I can be a bit of an airhead and ditzy.

In the past, people have noted the way my husband speaks to me, and have said he is too harsh and I deserve better.

I tried to leave a couple of years ago, but he convinced me to give him another chance. But I wonder this time did I deserve to be called incompetent?

If you made it this far, thank you. I just can't tell what is fair criticism and verbal abuse anymore."

 AITA for telling my girlfriend she 'ruined' my night by insisting she comes along?

My girlfriend and I (both 20f) have been dating for a year. My girlfriend-Jane and I have separate friend groups. Jane doesn't get along with my friends, yet insists she is brought along to our nights out/in. It's incredibly uncomfortable because whilst she's also a woman, these get-togethers are no-partners allowed parties. Plus, she doesn't get along with anyone so it's super awkward. I was invited out to one of their parties, and Jane got upset that I'm going without her. I'll be gone from 10am Friday to afternoon on Saturday. She has no issue with both of us going, but without her, it's an issue.
I said I'd leave later and try to get back earlier, but she wouldn't have it either. I ended up bringing her along and it was a nightmare. The mood was brought down and no one really had fun as all my friends seemed to be walking on eggshells around her.

When we got back, she kept gloating about how much fun she had, but I felt the opposite. I said 'well, I'm glad someone had fun.'. She got upset and asked what I meant. I explained that it was a friend night in, and she wasn't invited. She got super upset and pulled some crap about how it's 'toxic' that I want to have a night out without her. She says she's hurt that I 1) didn't want her there and 2) that I said she ruined the night.

I just wanted to spend time with my friends, 1 on 1. AITA?"

 First off English is not my first language so forgive my mistakes if any.

Long story short, I have a friend let's call her H who proposed we get together, I was down and started saving up for Money to contribute. She told me we'd be 12 girls in total, most are her friends I've met before but we're not close but I was fine with it since I was looking forward to making new friends.

Days later we agreed on an amount to contribute per person, we also agreed that after everyone contributes we will make a budget together keeping in mind people's allergies or diet restrictions.

Then on Monday H texted me and sent a document of the budget? I was shocked but still opened it and I found a lot of the food there were things I cannot eat due to allergies and food restrictions. I asked her about it and she answered that the majority agreed with those things and that I should get over it and that i can just eat the other things there.

I thought about it and decided I wouldn't go, and here's were I was called the asshole,I asked for my money back since I wasn't going to be attending. H and her friends are calling me a petty person because me backing out will do damage to their budget and so on. But I don't see the problem here, so reddit am I really being unreasonable here??"

 I imagine I'm gonna get raked over the coals for this one.

So, my fiancé (maybe not for much longer) and I were on our way back from a vacation recently. It was a great time and everything went off without an issue. That is until we started boarding the plane. Now, I know better, I only bring a small backpack with essentials incase I don't get my checked bags. I can survive out of this backpack and it will always pass baggage check for size and weight (done a lot of traveling so why fight the system). My fiancé didn't wanna listen to my advice and chose to bring basically a regular full-size bag that barely fits the standards of carry on, but generally speaking the airline worker doesn't wanna deal with the trouble and allows it through. But this time the airline worker was not having it. It was a packed flight, we were boarding last in economy and it was just a shit show. I got through just fine first with my little backpack, but I could hear the argument from the boarding tunnel thingy and it was getting heated. I was about to go back and try to smooth it out but my fiancé rushed pass and just boarded plane, I assumed not having heard it super clearly that the attended had given in and let her on. That was not the case!

So we found our seats and settled in. I was pretty tired and I could tell she was upset so I just kinda tucked into the window and put my hat down and tried to take a nap. But soon after the airline worker and a cop shows up and they are not fucking around, and want her off the plane. She tries to plead and cry, etc. but they are not having it. And maybe in a moment of panic or just plain self preservation...the cop asks if we're together, and I blurt out, ""NO!"" shaking my head emphatically. I got kill dagger eyes from her as she shot up and grabbed her bag and followed the cop out. She was also swearing and screaming the whole way out.

Now, obviously this is well after the event I'm posting this. But when she did eventually get home (she caught next flight out with the bag checked, lol), I was there to pick her up. She obviously thought I was the asshole, and to be honest almost everyone I know thinks I'm an asshole except my boss and co workers, who for context were very much relying on me to be back on time, which I gave my word I would, for a really important project that was time sensitive. They were all very happy I didn't get thrown off too.

So, am I the asshole for this self preservation?

AITA?"

 I, 26F, have been married to my husband, 28M for 2 years. We have been together for 4 years in total. I love my husband more than I can even express in words and our relationship never really had any major dips until last weekend.

In high school, I dated a guy, who we'll call Dan. Just to be clear, this is not my husband. I cannot remember exactly how long the relationship lasted, but it was no more than a year. We did a lot during the time we were together, a lot of our first experiences with some things were together. Things did not work out in the end as we both wanted different things in life so we ended the relationship and moved on from eachother.

My sister, 29F, ended up befriending Dan in college and they have gotten very close. Since it's been so long since our relationship ended, I really do not care, neither does Dan. He is very close with my family because he gets invited to so many of the family gatherings.

Last weekend it was my mothers birthday and there was a party thrown for her, which my entire family attended, along with family friends. Of course, my sister invited Dan. My husband and I usually do not attend birthday parties, but I insisted that we go to this one seeing as it was for my own mother. My husband agreed.


My husband works a very demanding job so he is normally unable to attend family gatherings, and so he's never met Dan, nor have I told him about my history with him.


At the party, Dan was introduced to my husband as my ex. It was my sister who introduced them while I was in the kitchen speaking to family. When I came back, my husband seemed a little off and when I asked him what was wrong he just brushed it off and wouldn't answer me.


During the dinner, my husband seemed distant and so I asked him again if he was feeling okay. He immediately stood up from his seat and seemed upset that I hadn't told him about Dan. I tried to explain to him that I didn't feel the need to but he didn't listen. He completely lost it and started to call me names that he has never called me before and he even said he didn't know if he could trust me anymore. This was all in front of my entire family and family friends.


I have been ignoring him since the party. He seems to feel very guilty and he keeps trying to apologise to me.

AITA?"

 Throwaway bc my husband knows my acc

My (25M) husband “Harry” (26M) has been in bed with the flu for about a week now. He’s quite miserable (headache, nausea, fairly high fever) so I’ve been working from home to be able to keep an eye on his throughout the day.

It was my younger siblings’ (twins, 9) birthday on Saturday and my husband and I were invited over to my parent’s house to celebrate.

On Friday, Harry told me he wasn’t feeling up to a children’s birthday party, which is understandable. I wouldn’t necessarily want to be around rowdy children if I was sick either.

So I decided I’d go there on my own, bring over the presents, stay for an hour or two and be back home before dinner. To be honest, after spending days holed up in our flat taking care of my husband, I was quite grateful for the opportunity to get outside for a few hours.

When I told Harry as much, he didn’t comment on it but he did seem a bit grumpy afterwards.

Saturday came and I drove over to my parent’s house in the afternoon (they live about 20 minutes away). I left Harry with some painkillers, tea and tissues on the nightstand so he wouldn’t need to get up while I was gone. I told him he could call me in case something happened, though.

The party went great and I got back home after about 2 hours without any calls from Harry so I assumed everything had gone well.

However, he was frowning all evening and when I asked whether he was alright, he called me selfish for leaving him alone and accused me of not caring about his well-being. He told my I should’ve stayed home with him instead of having fun on my own while he was miserable. He has since been giving me the silent treatment whenever I tried to talk to him about it.

It’s been a few days and I thought he’d have calmed down by now but he’s still sulking and I’m starting to wonder whether his reaction is reasonable and I’m the AH here."

 AITA For causing a scene when my mom threw away my teddy bear?

Not the A-hole
Throwaway since I definitely don't want this to be linked to my main, even though I know my parents won't see it.

Edit: Thank you for the advice on how to clean stuff bears! If I'm unable to do it myself, I'll look in a company that can renew/restore stuffed animals:) Also, I'm asking if my overreaction makes me an asshole. Not for having a stuffed animal at my age and that I should ""grow up."" I will be disgrading those comments.

I(19f) am in college. I'm just finishing up my first year. 10 years ago, my first childhood friend gifted me a white teddy bear with a cute little black dress and a bow on her right ear. I always had her on my bed and I would take her on any vacations whenever I'm staying the night. It's been well known in my family that she's a sentimental item to me. My old friend and I don't speak anymore and we have lost touched, but I still kept the teddy bear.

In 5th grade, I was gifted a red, fluffy jacket from my grandma and I almost wore it everyday. That, too, became a sentimental item. However, after middle school, my mom decided to throw it away. I was extremely mad at her and didn't speak to her for a day or two. So this isn't the first time she threw away a sentimental item.

Now, yesterday, I noticed my bear wasn't on my bed as normal. I searched around and just couldn't find her. She didn't fall underneath my bed and she didn't get up and just walk away. I asked my sister, but she didn't know. So then I asked my mom and she said she threw it away. I instantly panicked. I went over to the trash and saw its been taken it. I went into the garage and looked through the garbage bin and found it inside a trash bag. I ripped it open and took her out. She was so dirty, gross, and smelled so horrible. There was a lot of liquid all over her furr. I started to break down and went back upstairs. I yelled at my mom for doing this. She knew how special she was to me and she thought it was a good idea to throw it away since I was too old to be having stuffed animals. I cleaned her off in the bathroom sink, but she's still gross. Her white coat is now stained and I'm absolutely furious. She isn't the same anymore. I was ranting, crying, and slamming doors shut. My mom called my dad and after he got home from work, he yelled at me for screaming at my mother. I got grounded and they took my laptop away. I only managed to convince them to keep my phone was because of work and I needed my boss and co-workers to text me. My sister even commented on how I overreacted.

The whole ordeal lasted a fee hours of me sobbing and trying to clean her to the best of my abilities. She's back on my bed, but my sister is annoyed, my mom is crying, and my dad is angry at me. I'm not too sure if I did overreact or not. Everyone in the household is annoyed at the tantrum I threw. I texted one of my friends and he has my back, but my whole family doesn't like me right now. I don't know what to do. I'm tired and exhausted from the judgemental stares. Did I overreact? AITA for causing an unnecessary scene and making it bigger than it is?"

 I (39M), love giving gifts, I really enjoy putting thought and consideration into gifts for siblings, in-laws, nieces/nephews, and coworkers. For me, giving gifts isn’t about the price tag, it’s about showing the other person positive regard.

This evening, I visited my mother’s home for the family holiday (siblings, mother, in-laws, nieces/nephews). Just a sample of what I brought for people: stained glass window art, handmade porcelain bowls, and handmade silver jewelry.

I wasn’t expecting much tbh, I honestly do enjoy giving gifts, but if I had received no gifts, I’d have been fine with that. While I do enjoy receiving gifts, it isn’t a quid pro quo situation.

But these fricking family members did something worse. Like, a Starbucks gift card and a hot chocolate gift basket. The kind of presents that say “I put zero time/effort into this.” At best, I can bring these things to an office party or something like that.

When I noticed the incongruence, I just started feeling like a complete fool. As soon as I could slip away, I drove home. I didn’t flip out or say anything dumb, but I feel like I was being laughed at, the butt of some joke.

Now I’m home, just feel shitty and frustrated.

If someone reading this post has an alternative narrative that I can use, I’d love to hear it.

Thanks.

 Ok, I (28f) went over to my boyfriend’s (25m) house for the first time (been dating about a month), and I had somehow never noticed his pillow situation before. When I noticed, I made a comment about how long he’s had the pillows and apparently he’s been using them since he was a kid.

So, I asked him if he had any other pillows and he said he just had the pillow on the left of the first picture, but that his cat usually sleeps on it. I said I don’t really want to sleep on those pillows, and id prefer to sleep at my own place (with clean pillows).

His response? He waited for a minute and then said he would be sad to see that I would choose something as small as pillows come between us spending the night together, but that if I needed to go, that he understood.

I ended up going home and spending the night at my own house instead. I asked if I could bring my own pillows and gently suggested he get rid of his. He said it was totally fine for me to bring a pillow, but that he wouldn’t get rid of his, as they are ‘sentimental’.

Thoughts? I feel like I can’t even kiss him or anything while we’re sleeping because I don’t want him to get his gross pillowness all over me and my clean pillows. 😂"

I was absolutely furious! I just had to report this person because there was zero effort made on their part. In a fit of anger, I quickly contacted Amazon and shared a screenshot along with a photo of them biking away. For the record, you can’t see their face in the shot.

 AITA for thinking my girlfriend has low self esteem after meeting her friends

Asshole
I (28M) have been dating this girl (27F) for four months now and it's been so fantastic. She's pretty, funny, caring, and we have so many interests in common. She is smarter than me and has a great job and really just thriving in life.

We weren't ""official"" at first for a few months and she only started introducing me to her friends about a month ago.

First we went on a double date to restaurant with a gay couple, which was great. They were funny and awesome, just like my girlfriend. I didn't question in then.

Then we went to a potluck with her friends and one is in a wheelchair and another is so short they almost look like a child, like under 5 feet tall. Okay, still fine.

Last week I met one of her co-workers she is befriending for brunch and also my girlfriend's brother came. I didn't know her brother only had one leg and wears a fake leg. Her coworker is trans, in early stages of transitioning.

How does this fantastic amd thriving woman seem to only have friends who have struggles? I asked her if she has any friends that aren't disabled and she said, sure she does, so I just pointed out that I've never met them yet. She was a little irritated with me so I didn't go into too much detail about my observation so far. I did suggest that maybe she has low self esteem so forms relationships with people who are worse off than her so she can feel better about herself and talked about trying therapy. She didn't respond to me any more since that conversation except to call me a ""jerkface"" and it's been almost six days with only rare text responses from her that are mostly one word only.

I think it was a valid point to bring up. She admitted to me she takes anxiety meds so I thought maybe she looks badly at herself and wanted to help lift her up. Her life is hard for me to understand but she won't talk me through it to help me understand and learn about it.

I thought I was being supportive and nudging her towards support. But she felt differently. Was it really so bad what I did?"

 So this happened a couple of weeks ago at my local Walmart, and I still can't believe it actually happened.

It was one of those busy Saturday afternoons where everyone and their mother decides today is the day to do a full grocery run. I managed to snag one of the last decent shopping carts and was halfway through my list produce, some household stuff, a few snacks when this lady barrels around the corner and literally blocks my path.

She’s probably in her 50s, dressed like she’s heading to a country club.

Me: “Um… no, it’s mine. I’ve been using it for like twenty minutes.”

She scowls and gestures at the cart.

Rude Lady: “That’s the cart I left by the entrance while I went to get my coupons. It’s mine.”

Now, I’m staring at the cart my cart which has my purse, my reusable bags, and a bunch of groceries. Also, she said she left it by the entrance. I’m in the middle of the store, nowhere near the front.

Me: “This definitely isn’t your cart. I grabbed it when I walked in, and it already had someone else’s empty coffee cup in it.”

Rude Lady: “Well, it’s my cart now. You can take another one.”

At this point, a Walmart employee comes over, probably because she’s attracting attention with her Karen-level tone.

Employee: “Is there a problem here?”

Rude Lady: “Yes! She took my cart and is refusing to give it back!”

The employee looks at the cart. Then at me. Then back at her. He clearly knows what’s up.

Employee: “Ma’am, if she’s been using the cart and her items are in it, it’s not your cart. We can get you another one.”

Rude Lady: “I don’t want another one. I want that one! I already touched it, and it has better wheels.”

Better wheels. I kid you not. She was arguing over the wheels.

Eventually, after some more dramatic sighing and muttering about “the decline of respect in younger generations,” and “the young should respect the old”, she stomped off… and I saw her grab another cart, immediately start complaining about its squeaky wheel, and leave it behind in the cereal aisle.

People are wild."

 so i was just trying to have a chill night. did some pilates to decompress a bit. and then my boyfriend decides to go on a full hour-long rant about how much he hates rachel zegler — like, actual anger, showing me videos, replaying clips, all of it. because apparently… her facial expressions are annoying. she’s “full of herself,” “too smug,” “laughs too loud,” “thinks she’s smart,” and the biggest sin of all — she said the original snow white was scary when she was a kid.

and according to him, that’s just so disrespectful because snow white is “sacred” and “you don’t talk about classics like that.” dude. she said a movie scared her when she was little. that’s it.

and the whole time i’m just sitting there like… ok this feels off. like this is not about rachel zegler. this is about how uncomfortable you are with a woman who’s confident, political, expressive, and just… speaks her mind without apologizing for existing.

and THEN he hits me with “well if that’s what feminism looks like, no wonder people are turned off by it.” like it’s her job to make feminism cute and likable for dudes. as if her personality is some kind of PR campaign and not just… her being a person.

and then the best part — he tells me that i don’t actually like her either. that i’m only defending her because she’s feminist and that deep down i must find her annoying too. like??? sorry for having my own opinion i guess??

idk. i feel drained. the convo stressed me out more than my actual workout. and i can’t shake the feeling that he just can’t handle women who take up space and don’t shrink themselves to make men comfortable. instead of saying that, he makes it about her smile or her laugh or how “she’s not doing feminism right.”

am i overreacting? or is this just the most textbook patriarchal nonsense ever??"

 I know the title sounds silly but I'm talking about a dude in his 20s who is dropping his legitimate diploma to pursue singing full time as employment.

I (20sF) met him in middle school and we've been very close friends on and off ever since. I know he was born into a family who is very ""artistically inclined"", as in, everyone in his family is an artist, so he's always been passionate about singing. He was a nerdy studious kid who got the best grades and for most of the time, singing was just his side interest.

He used to get bullied for singing in school because, to be honest, he's a terrible singer. His voice is weak and shaky, he writes lyrics that are either very cliche or nonsensical, but I and all of his friends would clap and support him, first because we didn't want him to feel bad and secondly because we thought he could improve, but damn, talent shows were genuinely painful for us.

Fast forward to now, this guy has a good job in a well-paying respected field outside of the arts and is almost graduating from a prestigious school. However, he recently told us that even though he loves his job and his field, he noticed that he barely has time to sing and write songs now, and he is finally ready to make the big step and choose singing as his full-time activity. He had already quit his job by the time he told us that because he didn't want anyone ""talking him out of it"", but he will wait until the end of this semester to drop out of school.

For all of these years, he's been releasing original songs and he genuinely thinks / is convinced that they only get 50 to 100 views because he isn't releasing enough of them and putting in that extra time. He does everything to go viral on social media and never works out, but he always finds a couple of well-meaning but unhelpful strangers to comment ""it'll work brother, you just gotta practice more and work harder, fck what other people think"".

Talking to other friends about it, they're all shocked and worried about this decision, but since his family always supports him no matter what, they think that we won't be able to change his mind. Telling him the truth will just drive him away, my friends think that it's best to let him try and make the mistake by himself.

I think I should've said something way sooner and now I might be just an asshole if I tell him that, honestly, he's terrible at singing and songwriting.

The interior designer on the project simply told us to “do something with this” attic access. Wanting to go above and beyond, I decided to create something unique—a cabinet that opens into the attic.

I didn’t charge any extra for this feature, even though I could have just put up a piece of plywood and called it a day. I spent about 60 hours on this project, aiming to add value and a special touch. To ensure the cabinet door stayed shut properly, I installed a small mailbox lock. While it’s not the most visually appealing, it was necessary for the cabinet’s function.

Now, the interior designer has called the mailbox lock “unacceptable,” and the client insists we change it. After putting so much effort into this project, I’m frustrated that my work is being dismissed over a detail that was essential for functionality."

 Just like the title says. My husband invited over his friends for the previous Saturday. Only one person ended up attending. I spent Friday after work finishing the Tres Leches cake to go with the dinner he asked for. I sent home the guy with two pieces for himself and his fiancé. So far, it's Tuesday, and my husband hasn't even tried a piece. We were supposed to have some Sunday night while we watched our show. He kept putting it off, and then bed time came, so I asked him if I should just start the dishwasher or if we were going to have cake now, he said to just start the dishwasher. Last night we were going to have some after dinner. I went and got my own and some for my son, husband still won't try any. Not even a bite. I made almost a sheet cake for his friends, and he won't even try it. I told him last night how that made me feel after working so hard on it and he was apologetic and I asked him if he just didn't want any then I would stop offering, it's a soaked cake so it has to be eaten fairly quickly. He said that wasn't the case and that he just hadn't been hungry on Sunday or Saturday. I still don't quite understand why he couldn't have had a bite over the last 3 days that it's been made since he is eating the snickerdoodle cookies I made on Sunday no problem. Is this me having unrealistic expectations? I'm not wanting him to eat every piece, but he hasn't even had a bite since I made it, and I'm feeling very crestfallen. Thanks in advance, I guess."

 Hi, for some background information, I am 19 and live on my own. I pay my rent from student loans in my name, I pay for my phone on the phone bill, and they pay for my car that was a ""gift""

So, I've been on my own for almost a year in a half. I don't party, I don't go out much, and I work a 50 hour weeks to support myself. To treat myself to a job promotion, I decided to buy myself a new phone. My old phone was a iPhone, which had ""find my friends"", and my new phone is an android, where tracking isn't as easy.

When I lived with my mom all through high-school, she would track my phone to make sure I was going where I said I was. This was very frustrating because my mom has called me a bunch of names and we have a strained relationship as is. Because of this, I moved out. When I moved out, I told myself that I would turn off my GPS, but when I did, it caused a fight and she threatened to take away my car and called me a ""ungrateful bitch"", and then took my stimulus checks from me later down the road.

Upon getting my new phone, my stepmother looked at my mother and said ""we won't be able to use find my friends anymors"", and my mother started freaking out and having a panic attack. She kept trying to get me to change my mind on not getting a new phone, and told me I would understand when I have kids (bonus, I just got told I am infertile and will not be having kids). She also told me i was out of control, and that I was crazy and that I was hiding something. This isn't the case. At all. At this point, I was very frustrated and told her that I am a legal adult, and that it is very overbearing to act like that and that my friends parents don't track their phones.

She flipped her shit and called me ungrateful, an asshole, and accused me of doing something I don't want her to know about. Once again. I live on my own. I just don't want to be questioned anymore about what time I'm going to be home, or what time I'm going to be somewhere. I have found its toxic and gives me anxiety attacks.

So reddit, AITA for calling her overbearing? I've been trying to work on independency with my mother lately, but i might have been too rough."

 I hate it when I’m talking about something I really enjoy, something that I put a lot of emotion into explaining and talking about with someone, just for them to say something like “I wasn’t paying attention”. It just makes me feel like they don’t care about what I have to say even though I don’t do the same thing to them. Even when it’s just them looking away from me or doing something that you have to focus on to do makes me feel like they aren’t invested into the conversation like I am. I just wish that I had someone I could talk to that actually put as much effort into talking as I do. I feel like I pay attention most of the time to what people are saying especially when I know it’s something they like, so it kind of hurts when it feels like no one wants to do that for me.
I love watching movies. I know it’s nothing super duper serious that you have to pay attention to but it’s something I really like. I love being invested and watching franchises and stuff and being able to talk about it and express my thoughts and excitement around it. I know that not everyone I met will feel about it the way I do but I still would like to be able to talk about it without feeling like I’m forcing the other person to talk with me. I’m not sure if there’s something I’m doing wrong but I don’t act that way when they talk about something I don’t personally care for. I still listen and comment and let them talk about what they like. I just feel like every time I bring up movies in general that they don’t feel like watching everyone just turns their ears off and zone out on what I’m saying as if it doesn’t matter. And like I said it’s nothing super serious but I still like talking about things I enjoy like that. You don’t have to have viewed something to listen about someone talk about it. It might make it easier to understand but if there’s something you don’t get I know I could explain it. It just seems like nobody wants me to. I wish there was someone who actually wanted me to talk about this stuff. Someone who cared as much as I did. It would make things way easier and it wouldn’t make me feel like a burden or like the person I’m talking to doesn’t care about me when it’s just what I have to say. I’m not sure why things have to be this complicated. It’s just kind of upsetting and always degrading when they say they zoned out. I know that they probably aren’t doing it on purpose and that they probably think I just look at it like it’s a joke but sometimes it actually does hurt my feelings a bit. I wish I didn’t care this much but it’s hard not to."

 So a bit of background first. Husband and I have been together for 9 years (since high school), married for 4. His sister is older, now in her early 30s and married with a 6 month old daughter. She's a teacher (I have total sympathy for teacher salaries sucking as I'm in education as well) and her husband has a good, salaried job in the automotive industry.

Ever since we've been together, and maybe even before then with her other family members, she always does handmade gifts- really terrible paintings. When she was in her early 20s and in college it was one thing. I get it, I've been a cash strapped college student before too, but it never stopped. We exchange Christmas lists or give indicators as to what we might like every year and we always spend at least a decent amount of money getting her what she asked for (averaging around $50 probably) as well as now for her husband and this year for her daughter. Even as a wedding gift she made us a painting which looked like an 8 year old could have done it. Not even like cool and abstract, just terrible wine and paint night type art. It's sitting in the closet now, never having been hung cause it's horrible but I feel like an asshole if I throw it away.

So we recently asked what they might like for Christmas this year and when she asked what we wanted my husband said ""anything on my Amazon wishlist, I'll send you the link"" she says ""well I already know what I got you isn't on your wishlist cause I made it"". Like why even ask us what we want then and UGH another painting!

Don't get me wrong, I think handmade things are great from kids or if you have a particular talent, but otherwise it's not fair to ask people for things that cost actual money and get them and give something unwanted and terrible in return. To be fair we've never expressed these feelings cause it seems mean but also isn't it a given that your adult brother and his wife don't want your terrible paintings? Even if we did want them and like them enough to hang, our house would now be covered in her paintings which is weird too!

To add to that, when we visit and by accounts of everyone else we know in their life, they spend ridiculous amounts of money eating out and buying whatever they want. She even confessed to me that she'd love to quit working and stay home but that they couldn't maintain their current lifestyle that way. No judgment (ok a little judgment)- but if you really want to stay home to raise your child you can't cut back on the other stuff a little?

So AITA if I say something or just continue getting horrible gifts for the rest of my life while spending our money on her and her family?"

 I imagine I'm gonna get raked over the coals for this one.

So, my fiancé (maybe not for much longer) and I were on our way back from a vacation recently. It was a great time and everything went off without an issue. That is until we started boarding the plane. Now, I know better, I only bring a small backpack with essentials incase I don't get my checked bags. I can survive out of this backpack and it will always pass baggage check for size and weight (done a lot of traveling so why fight the system). My fiancé didn't wanna listen to my advice and chose to bring basically a regular full-size bag that barely fits the standards of carry on, but generally speaking the airline worker doesn't wanna deal with the trouble and allows it through. But this time the airline worker was not having it. It was a packed flight, we were boarding last in economy and it was just a shit show. I got through just fine first with my little backpack, but I could hear the argument from the boarding tunnel thingy and it was getting heated. I was about to go back and try to smooth it out but my fiancé rushed pass and just boarded plane, I assumed not having heard it super clearly that the attended had given in and let her on. That was not the case!

So we found our seats and settled in. I was pretty tired and I could tell she was upset so I just kinda tucked into the window and put my hat down and tried to take a nap. But soon after the airline worker and a cop shows up and they are not fucking around, and want her off the plane. She tries to plead and cry, etc. but they are not having it. And maybe in a moment of panic or just plain self preservation...the cop asks if we're together, and I blurt out, ""NO!"" shaking my head emphatically. I got kill dagger eyes from her as she shot up and grabbed her bag and followed the cop out. She was also swearing and screaming the whole way out.

Now, obviously this is well after the event I'm posting this. But when she did eventually get home (she caught next flight out with the bag checked, lol), I was there to pick her up. She obviously thought I was the asshole, and to be honest almost everyone I know thinks I'm an asshole except my boss and co workers, who for context were very much relying on me to be back on time, which I gave my word I would, for a really important project that was time sensitive. They were all very happy I didn't get thrown off too.

So, am I the asshole for this self preservation?

AITA?"

 On Mother’s Day I got and treated my mom to some of her favorite things and places while we spent the whole day together. I went to church with her along with the Mother’s Day Brunch. I also took her shopping and to her favorite expensive restaurant for dinner. In between stops, I gifted her a card, her favorite candies, favorite flowers, and a $200 gc to her favorite spa.

Sometime during the day, I posted on Facebook with a gif photo of an animated mother hugging her child that said “Happy Mother’s Day to all Moms. We love and appreciate everything you do.” I also wrote a paragraph about how thankful and grateful I am for my own mother and I wouldn’t be who I am without her.

About an hour after I get home from dinner, my mom texts me that she didn’t see her Facebook post from me. I told her that I did post to Facebook about Mother’s Day. She then says that she wants her own Facebook post and that if I don’t do it, she must not mean all that much to me. When she texted that I was taken aback. I responded are you serious? I took you out and treated you all day and gave you gifts all day, but none of that matters because of a Facebook post. I called her ungrateful and said we’re going to have another “time out” period. Since then she’s been calling everyone about how disrespectful of a daughter I am. Even my dad is trying to tell me that it’s okay for her to be upset and that I should just get over and excuse it because of what all shes done for me in the past.

Side note: I have had several time out periods with my mother. My mother had the tendency to say something rude or a dig at a person, but when she’s called out on it, she will play like she doesn’t remember what she said. Or will use tears to make it seem like you’re being mean to her."

 Recently, I [25m] was visiting some family, including my cousin [28f], who has a PhD in computer science— relevant later.

For some background info, growing up, I was always seen as the ‘smart’ one in the family, which she resented me for due to wanting that title herself. She was a lot more studious than I am, and got a PhD, whereas I ended my schooling after my bachelors due to not liking specialization. I’m currently a filmmaker that has been surprisingly successful, and she works at a hedge fund doing quant work.

Regarding my opinion on her, I think she’s quite smart in her niche. However, she lacks what I see as traits of a more generalized intelligence— being quick witted, adaptable, open minded, and exploratory. Every truly intelligent person I’ve ever met has been funny and a genuinely interesting person, and I don’t see that in her. She’s more what I would call a ‘sweat’— she works hard, and is talented in her niche, but lacking the originality to be truly intelligent.

Anyhow, when I visited my family, she began needling me about how now she has her PhD (the last time I had seen her, she was still in her program) I had to admit that she was smarter than me. I shrugged it off mostly, but she began demanding that I ‘admit’ she’s smarter than her, so I responded that PhD or no PhD, I don’t think she’s exceptionally intelligent or more intelligent than I am.

This caused her to fly off the handle, and she started yelling that I was just a jealous AH who couldn’t accept that a woman was smarter than her. She furthered that she was confident and secure in the fact she was more intelligent than I was.

I pointed out that if she was so secure in her own intelligence, my disputing it wouldn’t bother her that much, and the fact she needed me to validate her shows she’s not particularly confident. She just got angry again, called me an AH, and stormed off.

AITA? I think she shouldn’t have started a conversation about her intelligence if She just wanted me to sing her praises"

I (M32) was driving around with my buddy (M41) and we were discussing a friend of his who he recently spoke with. He was praising how intelligent that guy was and how rare it is to speak with someone who is that sharp. After ragging on how dumb the average person is, he then causally threw out that he believed he was smarter than 95% of the population.

I couldn’t help myself. I suddenly let out a big chuckle followed by 60seconds of friendly interrogation as to why he believed this. It was obvious I had upset him. He’s a very sensitive moody guy who in many ways hasn’t evolved past his teenage angst phase, but still, a ridiculous claim deserves scrutiny. He’s not a dummy but he’s far from a genius. All of our mutual friends would agree.

Most of the time he’s a humble guy but he will occasionally throw out snobby comments about how stupid people are and what a waste most things seem to be. We work in the same field and sometimes when I disagree with him about his methods, he’ll be quick to toss out his counter argument, “You just don’t understand what I’m trying to do.” It’s little comments like that that give me zero qualms about shutting down his feelings of grandiosity whenever they arise."

Before you ask no, this is not the teacher's perspective on the 'AITA for screaming at my son's teacher an making her cry?' post.

Last Wednesday I was teaching my class when a student approached me and told me he had a migrane, he asked if he could go to the nurse and ask to go home because he felt really bad. I assumed that the kid was either just trying to get out of class, especially because this was in math which he doesn't do particularly well in or he just had a headache and was over exaggerating as kids do ( he is 8, I honestly didn't think he even knew what a migrane is). I told him to drink some water and sit back down and if he still felt bad after the lesson then I would take him to the nurse during break and he could have some Calpol. I figured this would work with both options, since he still had to stay in maths and if he actually was sick he wouldn't mind missing his break, we would also need to call his mum to give him Calpol, who would confirm if he actually had a migrane or was just over exaggerating.

However about 10 minutes later I heard a loud thud and turned around to see he had fainted and was now lying on the floor unconscious. I immediately sent another student to get the nurse and began trying to wake him up. He regained consciousness after about 2 minutes and we got him some water. The receptionist rung his mum and she picked him up around 10 minutes later. The next 2 days he wasn't present in class and I began to grow concerned. On Monday before school started his mum came in and began to scream at me, threatening to call the police on me for criminal negligence and get me fired, she also said some other things which I won't repeat, she then told me her son will no longer be present in my class and she would get him moved to another class.

At the time my reasoning made sense but now I'm starting to think I'm in the wrong. AITA?"

Bit of a stupid question but I just want to see if I'm wrong.

Background: my girlfriend and I do long distance. We see each other 4-5 times a year for a week or two each time. We have been dating for 1.5 years.

As the title suggests, my girlfriend woke up and was quiet. I tried talking to her but she didn't respond. She quietly made her food while I was helping her pack. She ate the food and then told me im an inconsiderate person for not helping her (make food for her) when she had low blood sugar. I could not tell since she was walking around normally (or that's what I thought). I asked her to communicate this but she thinks I should be able to tell because she can't speak when she has low blood sugar. She is currently mad at me. This has happened once before so maybe I should have picked up on it but somehow didn't.

So AITA or should she have given some sort of a clue to let me know she's feeling unwell?"

 AITA for backing out of a 15-minute favor when it suddenly turned into an hour-plus-long ordeal?
Context: I work from home two days per week; today is one of those days. My wife's workday ends at 4:00, mine ends at 5:30.

Today, when my wife got home (about 4:15), she called me downstairs pretty much as soon as she came in the front door, to tell me that she's left her car running and would I please take it over to Discount Tire (DT) because one of the tires is low. (For those not aware, DT provides complementary inflation and (non-sidewall) tire repairs.) Without complaint, I agree because it's only a 5-minute drive each way, so I can just take a quick 15-minute break from work. I drive her car down there, and the guy tops up 3 tires, but on the 4th his machine won't dispense any air. I see him check it with a manual pressure gauge and then he comes up to the window and tells me that the tire is under 15 PSI, so he can't inflate it, but he says they're not very busy right now, they could repair the tire after only about a half-hour wait. I let him know that I need to get back to work, is there any way he can add even a little bit of air so I can maybe have my wife bring it back and wait? He says no, because it's ""basically flat"".

I call my wife to let her know this - my intention is to ask her if I drive back home, would she want to drive it back to DT now since the wait is relatively short (when they're busy, it can be a 2+hour wait), or if not I can at least make an appointment while I'm here. But I don't even get that far; she just wants me to stay and wait for it (even though she's already done working for the day). I tell her I really need to get back to work, and she gets very upset. I ask DT Guy what exactly he meant by ""basically flat"" and he said I'm at 13 PSI. I confirm with him that this means I'm not at immediate risk of the rim tearing up the inside of the tire if I drive it back home right now, so I tell my wife that I'm coming back and I'll be there in 5 minutes. As I'm driving home I get a couple of texts, including ""I'll just have you drive me to work tomorrow and my car can sit in the f***ing driveway for all I care"", but of course I don't read them until I get home.

I go inside to make another attempt to explain the specifics of the situation (I haven't even been able to tell her that it's not actually flat flat, yet), but she refuses to listen to a word of it, telling me she isn't going to listen to anything I have to say for the next week, and that I've ""ruined everything"".

I don't recall every word exchanged, but I know I did tell her that she was acting like a child, and in the end saying ""Fine, I'll go back there and I'll just have to work until 8pm tonight!"" to which she responded with ""Good, I don't want to see you!""

I did go back to DT, and started composing this post while waiting.

AITA?

Editing to answer some common questions.

We do own a portable air compressor, it takes about 5 minutes for it to fill one tire, and it's in the trunk of her car.
Taking care of car things is my chore, but every time she's asked me to inflate her tires I have done so - I wasn't neglecting them. Also, the last time I put air in, I told her that she needs to make a trip to DT after work ASAP (because I work until 5:30 and DT closes at 6:00) to get that tire checked for damage, since it loses air faster than the others.
She is generally in charge of discretionary spending, so if the tire had needed to be replaced (repairs are free at DT), she would need to be there to compare the options available.
DT is the opposite direction from home as her work, that's probably why she didn't go there on her way home from work.
She didn't drive my car to DT because we only have one key for it, and it didn't occur to me to take it out of my pocket before leaving.
No, she is not like this all the time."

 I know they’re undercover agents working for an secret organization for god knows how long now. My voices in my head told me everything, I connected all the dots. & everything makes perfect sense. They’ve been gathering Intel on me then sending it to their secret organization that works for a national organization (FBI,CIA,NSA)

I know undercover agents are watching me & following me when I leave the house & they have hidden cameras around my apartment building to watch when I leave my apartment. The voices are telling me all the details as I speak, so I know it’s true. The voices told me everything I needed to know, I know they’re in cahoots with some organization under cover. I know ppl are watching me via undercover agents/ hidden cameras & they are all undercover.

They’re trying to gradually extract info from me cuz I know where the aliens are, that info I ain’t disclosing to them whatever secret organization they’re with I know they’ve already have a ton of Intel on me as it is. My voices told me where aliens are but I ain’t gonna disclose that info cuz I know ppl are watching my every move via hidden cameras & undercover agents. Plus they’re all undercover agents.

My voices also said that some aliens are walking among us disguised as normal ppl. Another reason why is when I called them out about the fact that they’re all undercover agents & what their true motives about acquiring where the aliens were they removed me from the group chat they knew they were caught so they removed me completely to maintain their cover.

I know they’re all undercover agents my voices confirmed it & what their true motives are. Plus the other night at around 10:30 pm I heard a knock at my door and the doorbell rung. I didn’t answer it cuz I know Danielle Courtney & them sent undercover agents to my door to try to acquire about the aliens I know of. I was freaking out for real, I was like I ain’t say shit to them. I know that there are aliens in disguise walking among us my voices told me."

 My(19M) girlfriend(19F) is a very private person. She never posts anything on social media, and usually she tends to be very secretive, like I found that she kind of drives conversations towards talking about me, and my interests. But it’s really hard to learn more about her because she doesn’t let me. She’s like this everyone except for her best friend Marie.

Above all else, she is super super possessive about her phone, she’s never showed me any of her photos or anything, she always takes her phone with her, she has one of those advanced passcodes, and she always turns her phone away from my direction, and just acts a little sus in general.

This has caused me lots of mental torture, as I don’t know what’s going on, if she even likes me, I keep on thinking I’m not good enough for her, and it just feels weird that she’s so cautious around me."

 so i was just trying to have a chill night. did some pilates to decompress a bit. and then my boyfriend decides to go on a full hour-long rant about how much he hates rachel zegler — like, actual anger, showing me videos, replaying clips, all of it. because apparently… her facial expressions are annoying. she’s “full of herself,” “too smug,” “laughs too loud,” “thinks she’s smart,” and the biggest sin of all — she said the original snow white was scary when she was a kid.

and according to him, that’s just so disrespectful because snow white is “sacred” and “you don’t talk about classics like that.” dude. she said a movie scared her when she was little. that’s it.

and the whole time i’m just sitting there like… ok this feels off. like this is not about rachel zegler. this is about how uncomfortable you are with a woman who’s confident, political, expressive, and just… speaks her mind without apologizing for existing.

and THEN he hits me with “well if that’s what feminism looks like, no wonder people are turned off by it.” like it’s her job to make feminism cute and likable for dudes. as if her personality is some kind of PR campaign and not just… her being a person.

and then the best part — he tells me that i don’t actually like her either. that i’m only defending her because she’s feminist and that deep down i must find her annoying too. like??? sorry for having my own opinion i guess??

idk. i feel drained. the convo stressed me out more than my actual workout. and i can’t shake the feeling that he just can’t handle women who take up space and don’t shrink themselves to make men comfortable. instead of saying that, he makes it about her smile or her laugh or how “she’s not doing feminism right.”

am i overreacting? or is this just the most textbook patriarchal nonsense ever??"

Before you ask no, this is not the teacher's perspective on the 'AITA for screaming at my son's teacher an making her cry?' post.

Last Wednesday I was teaching my class when a student approached me and told me he had a migrane, he asked if he could go to the nurse and ask to go home because he felt really bad. I assumed that the kid was either just trying to get out of class, especially because this was in math which he doesn't do particularly well in or he just had a headache and was over exaggerating as kids do ( he is 8, I honestly didn't think he even knew what a migrane is). I told him to drink some water and sit back down and if he still felt bad after the lesson then I would take him to the nurse during break and he could have some Calpol. I figured this would work with both options, since he still had to stay in maths and if he actually was sick he wouldn't mind missing his break, we would also need to call his mum to give him Calpol, who would confirm if he actually had a migrane or was just over exaggerating.

However about 10 minutes later I heard a loud thud and turned around to see he had fainted and was now lying on the floor unconscious. I immediately sent another student to get the nurse and began trying to wake him up. He regained consciousness after about 2 minutes and we got him some water. The receptionist rung his mum and she picked him up around 10 minutes later. The next 2 days he wasn't present in class and I began to grow concerned. On Monday before school started his mum came in and began to scream at me, threatening to call the police on me for criminal negligence and get me fired, she also said some other things which I won't repeat, she then told me her son will no longer be present in my class and she would get him moved to another class.

At the time my reasoning made sense but now I'm starting to think I'm in the wrong. AITA?"

 AITA for not asking if someone was okay?
Asshole
So earlier today I was sitting in my car waiting for my wife. I’m a 32 year old man and my wife is 31. But as I was waiting for my wife I saw a girl that looked to be about 14 years old walking with her little sister. This girl lives in our building with her family. But because we live in New York City there’s concrete practically everywhere and it was wet. And in our building we have a parking lot for the whole complex, but the ground was wet because they had been cleaning. The girl was carrying her little sister who’s about 3, and she slipped and fell on the concrete. She landed on what looked to be her butt and lower back, while she made sure her sister didn’t hit the ground.

I had my windows down and could hear the girl yelp as she hit the ground, and you could hear her hit the ground. She then stayed where she was for about 45 seconds all the while making sure her sister was okay. She then helped her sister up and then got up off the ground. But when she started walking she had a noticeable limp that wasn’t there before she fell. I then went back to minding my own business after the girl wasn’t in my line of sight anymore. My wife then got back in the car and told me she had seen the girl fall and that she spoke to her to make sure she was okay. And then she asked me why I hadn’t said anything to make sure she wasn’t seriously injured seeing that her parents weren’t with her. And I told her that I didn’t care because she wasn’t my kid.

My wife then told me the least I could’ve done was warn her about the ground being wet. So again I told her not my kid not my problem. She then said how if that was our kid then we would’ve wanted someone to warn her, but seeing as she’s not my kid I don’t care what happens to her. So AITA for not asking the girl if she was okay?"

 I (F52) wear prescription glasses and have done since I was eight years old. I have really bad myopia (I'm nearsighted) and I'm essentially legally blind without my eyewear. As a child, I was bullied and was actually told that having glasses didn't make me better or smarter than the other girls. (No kidding! I never thought they did!)
So, I currently work in an elementary school and in recent years have noticed an upswing in students coming to school wearing ""fake"" glasses, by which I specifically mean glasses that either have non-corrective lenses or have no lenses at all. I try to ignore it but I find it both distracting and disrespectful. One child was wearing a pair that were quite obviously broken frames with the lens orbit completely snapped and incapable of even holding a lens anymore. Those glasses frames ought to have been thrown away because the sharp edge (especially so near to the eyes) was dangerous. The ""glasses"" were put on and removed dozens of times and used as a distraction from doing schoolwork. Another student, a 7-year old, came in a pair that are a copy of the prop worn by the character Elphaba in the recent Wicked movie, but the glasses are adult sized and because they don't fit the child, routinely obstruct her vision. Again, they had non-corrective lenses. She repeatedly asked those around her, ""Don't they make me look smart?""

I reported the issues to administration and was told that I had to allow the students to continue to wear the glasses because I had no authority to say anything about their ""choices in apparel"" since there's nothing about using non-functional medical devices in the school's dress code. Furthermore, I was told that the kids were just having fun and ""don't be so sensitive""."

 I (F21) and my boyfriend (M23) of five years went to my favorite restaurant a few weeks ago. The meal was great and we both really enjoyed ourselves. It was perfect, a completely perfect dinner. I paid the $60 check and we went out to the parking lot to the car. I live in a huge college town along with that Saturday night being a senior ball so the town was busy.

We get back to the car and the cars surrounding it was parked exactly the same as they were when we went in. There were cars to each side of his car along with a truck parallel parked behind him at least two car lengths away. In front of him was the wall of the restaurant and behind him was the roadway in the parking lot then the parallel parked truck at a distance to clarify.

He starts to back out of the space and after a few tries he says he can’t do it. I say instantly I can spot him so he can get out. He says no and that it won’t help him because the truck behind him wasn’t there when he pulled into the spot and he was scared of hitting it. (It was there when he pulled into the spot.) He also added he doesn’t want others to see me spotting him like he can’t handle his vehicle. I say okay, I’ll go into the restaurant and find the owner of one of the car and ask if there was any way they would move so he could get out, didn’t want to but it was the only choice. He says no and kinda flips his shit (throwing his hat and sunglasses into the dash in frustration and also flooring it as if he’s going to hit the building then slamming on the break before he does so.) He calls his parents screaming about not being able to get out of the spot and even locked my door when I tried to get out of the vehicle to go get someone else to help/spot him.

Also when he is on the phone the owner of one of the neighboring cars comes outside. I try to tell him that we talk to her but he ignored me and kept complaining to his parents how there was no way we were getting out of the spot. The owner of the neighboring car gets in another car and leaves while my boyfriend gets off the phone and says: “guess we’re stuck.”

The screaming and me begging him to just let me spot him continues for 20 minutes and he makes a few jabs that I don’t have a license so I wouldn’t understand how he feels. At that point I was really upset and in tears. I had just taken him out to dinner and spent a pretty good amount of money for him to show his ass? Finally he lets me out of the car to spot him and within 2 minutes we are out of the spot.

Later that night I told him that he ruined the night and the dinner I paid for for absolutely no reason. I also added that he always has to find away to destroy any date or thing in general I want to do just because it’s not something he picks. He said that what happened was my fault because I should’ve have not spoken to him because it made him more frustrated when he was trying to find a “solution to the problem.” AITA here?"

 so , long story short , i was at school , following my classmates to our next classroom. i stopped a bit to talk with another friend from another class , as i was doing so , i noticed my class was getting a bit distant , so i started following them again. and as i did. i got a bit left behind. as i was passing through some 11th graders classroom. i caught one severly staring at me with a really disturbing stare. when i turned around i noticed they were two. i didnt expect for them to be staring at me for long. i tried saying hi (i was standing still without moving) and they kept staring at me with a look in their eyes i cant describe. i at that moment felt extremely uncomfortable as i then i started to walk away. another guy (from the same class as them) was laughing and saying something about me probably , as i got uncomfortable , i decided to leave. i walked for a few steps and i could hear them whispering something about my leather jacket. some of them were 17 or 16. hell i dont even know. that just made me uncomfortable because it happened out of the blue and i never did anything to them or talk to them. i just know that im really uncomfortable about all this and maybe im overreacting"

 ""Unfortunately, your order couldn’t be delivered.” 
AIO for reporting a lazy delivery person?
I was absolutely furious! I just had to report this person because there was zero effort made on their part. In a fit of anger, I quickly contacted Amazon and shared a screenshot along with a photo of them biking away. For the record, you can’t see their face in the shot. Do you think I overreacted by taking this seriously? It all went down in just a few minutes, and I’m still seething! What would you have done?"

 My husband (M27) and I (F28) have been married for almost 4 years now, been together for 6 years. Do I have a roommate or husband? As more and more days go by I feel like I have a roommate more that a husband. I am and have been the sole income for our relationship and I come home and have to be the one who has to cleans, cooks, and take care of the animals. All while he is sleeping all day and chooses to play video games all night. I have asked for more help with the responsibilities of the house and he says he will but it only last for a week before we are in the same routine all over again. He did manage to get a job after 5 years into the relationship but all the responsibilities at home have still falling into my lap. I am still the only one paying our bills and don't ever have money for myself while anything he makes is used how he pleases. And on top of all that we are not intimate and any way anymore. It has gotten to the point if I try to initiate something in the bedroom and shrugs me off. I won't lie and say that doesn't hurt and has caused me to feel like I am the problem or no longer attractive in his eyes. But it has been almost 3 years now and I don't even think I would want to anymore even if he tried. I have gone back and forth about if I should stay in the marriage but have been to scared of the unknown of leaving to take the leap.

 (Trow away since some people I know in RL know my account)

My sister in law is a really crafty person. And for Christmas she DIYs many of the presents she gives out to other people. tbh I didn't really like any of the gifts she gave me.

some of them where:

Christmas ornaments with photos from our pets and our son (way too kitschy for my taste)
Whiskey based self made liqueur with a family photo as label (I love Whiskey, but pure and not in a cream liqueur)
a tote bag with a painted wolf(the design was nice and wolfes are one of my favourite animals, but I don't use tote bags)
I dropped a comment to my wife that I hope SIL doesn't gift me any more ""DIYed shit"" this year, because I really have no use for it. She lost her shit qt me and called me ""a bitter and ungrateful person"" because apparently everyone in her family loves the ""thoughtful gifts"" of SIL.

idk but I still feel DIYed stuff should only be an addition to a real present. And it's not like she's poor and couldn't buy presents. Am I the asshole here?"

 I know the title sounds silly but I'm talking about a dude in his 20s who is dropping his legitimate diploma to pursue singing full time as employment.

I (20sF) met him in middle school and we've been very close friends on and off ever since. I know he was born into a family who is very ""artistically inclined"", as in, everyone in his family is an artist, so he's always been passionate about singing. He was a nerdy studious kid who got the best grades and for most of the time, singing was just his side interest.

He used to get bullied for singing in school because, to be honest, he's a terrible singer. His voice is weak and shaky, he writes lyrics that are either very cliche or nonsensical, but I and all of his friends would clap and support him, first because we didn't want him to feel bad and secondly because we thought he could improve, but damn, talent shows were genuinely painful for us.

Fast forward to now, this guy has a good job in a well-paying respected field outside of the arts and is almost graduating from a prestigious school. However, he recently told us that even though he loves his job and his field, he noticed that he barely has time to sing and write songs now, and he is finally ready to make the big step and choose singing as his full-time activity. He had already quit his job by the time he told us that because he didn't want anyone ""talking him out of it"", but he will wait until the end of this semester to drop out of school.

For all of these years, he's been releasing original songs and he genuinely thinks / is convinced that they only get 50 to 100 views because he isn't releasing enough of them and putting in that extra time. He does everything to go viral on social media and never works out, but he always finds a couple of well-meaning but unhelpful strangers to comment ""it'll work brother, you just gotta practice more and work harder, fck what other people think"".

Talking to other friends about it, they're all shocked and worried about this decision, but since his family always supports him no matter what, they think that we won't be able to change his mind. Telling him the truth will just drive him away, my friends think that it's best to let him try and make the mistake by himself.

I think I should've said something way sooner and now I might be just an asshole if I tell him that, honestly, he's terrible at singing and songwriting.

 I, 26F, have been married to my husband, 28M for 2 years. We have been together for 4 years in total. I love my husband more than I can even express in words and our relationship never really had any major dips until last weekend.

In high school, I dated a guy, who we'll call Dan. Just to be clear, this is not my husband. I cannot remember exactly how long the relationship lasted, but it was no more than a year. We did a lot during the time we were together, a lot of our first experiences with some things were together. Things did not work out in the end as we both wanted different things in life so we ended the relationship and moved on from eachother.

My sister, 29F, ended up befriending Dan in college and they have gotten very close. Since it's been so long since our relationship ended, I really do not care, neither does Dan. He is very close with my family because he gets invited to so many of the family gatherings.

Last weekend it was my mothers birthday and there was a party thrown for her, which my entire family attended, along with family friends. Of course, my sister invited Dan. My husband and I usually do not attend birthday parties, but I insisted that we go to this one seeing as it was for my own mother. My husband agreed.


My husband works a very demanding job so he is normally unable to attend family gatherings, and so he's never met Dan, nor have I told him about my history with him.


At the party, Dan was introduced to my husband as my ex. It was my sister who introduced them while I was in the kitchen speaking to family. When I came back, my husband seemed a little off and when I asked him what was wrong he just brushed it off and wouldn't answer me.


During the dinner, my husband seemed distant and so I asked him again if he was feeling okay. He immediately stood up from his seat and seemed upset that I hadn't told him about Dan. I tried to explain to him that I didn't feel the need to but he didn't listen. He completely lost it and started to call me names that he has never called me before and he even said he didn't know if he could trust me anymore. This was all in front of my entire family and family friends.


I have been ignoring him since the party. He seems to feel very guilty and he keeps trying to apologise to me.

 In my (F18) country 18th birthday is special because it is the legal age. It's typical to have a bigger party, family celebration or other thing like that. As it happened, on the day of my birthday was my close cousin's wedding, an event which my whole family had (and wanted) to attend.

I had no problem with that. My cousin had a whole big event to plan while being tight on budget and if the place she wanted was free on the date of my birthday, then so be it (she wanted for her wedding to take place in a rather picturesque place which is almost always reserved, so she had to take any date which was free). I planned with my parents that we'll celebrate my birthday one week later and that they'll let me hit a club with some of my friends an evening after the wedding as a sort of late celebration. I was actually very happy with this solution.

On the day of my birthday my parents sang me ""happy birthday"", gave symbolic gifts and off we went for the wedding. Everything was going great but at one point during reception my mother started silencing the band, got the microphone and told to the whole family that my 18th birthday is today and that they have to sing me ""happy birthday"". She and dad also proceeded to give me big gifts AND a special torte which I was sure I'll receive only one week later.

It was horrendously awkward, both for me and the guests, half of whom I didn't even know. I felt humiliated and like I destroyed my cousin's (with whom I'm very close) wedding. I firmly believe that one shouldn't make another person's big day about themselves and I never, ever wanted my parents to pull something like that. I spent rest of the reception hiding in the corner, hoping that nobody thinks that I really wanted my parents to do a scene during the reception.

When we returned from the reception, my parents were beaming at me, proud of the surprise they did for me and basically they wanted me to praise and thank them. They also said that they called of the celebration next week, since I had ""such a big moment"" on the wedding day.

I honestly told them that I was feeling humiliated, that I'd really prefer a smaller celebration at home than forced ""happy birthday"" from the crowd and that I feel like they ruined both my birthday and, what's more important, my cousin's wedding.

Needless to say they're mad at me and say that I'm ungrateful, spoiled brat.

 I hate it when I’m talking about something I really enjoy, something that I put a lot of emotion into explaining and talking about with someone, just for them to say something like “I wasn’t paying attention”. It just makes me feel like they don’t care about what I have to say even though I don’t do the same thing to them. Even when it’s just them looking away from me or doing something that you have to focus on to do makes me feel like they aren’t invested into the conversation like I am. I just wish that I had someone I could talk to that actually put as much effort into talking as I do. I feel like I pay attention most of the time to what people are saying especially when I know it’s something they like, so it kind of hurts when it feels like no one wants to do that for me.
I love watching movies. I know it’s nothing super duper serious that you have to pay attention to but it’s something I really like. I love being invested and watching franchises and stuff and being able to talk about it and express my thoughts and excitement around it. I know that not everyone I met will feel about it the way I do but I still would like to be able to talk about it without feeling like I’m forcing the other person to talk with me. I’m not sure if there’s something I’m doing wrong but I don’t act that way when they talk about something I don’t personally care for. I still listen and comment and let them talk about what they like. I just feel like every time I bring up movies in general that they don’t feel like watching everyone just turns their ears off and zone out on what I’m saying as if it doesn’t matter. And like I said it’s nothing super serious but I still like talking about things I enjoy like that. You don’t have to have viewed something to listen about someone talk about it. It might make it easier to understand but if there’s something you don’t get I know I could explain it. It just seems like nobody wants me to. I wish there was someone who actually wanted me to talk about this stuff. Someone who cared as much as I did. It would make things way easier and it wouldn’t make me feel like a burden or like the person I’m talking to doesn’t care about me when it’s just what I have to say. I’m not sure why things have to be this complicated. It’s just kind of upsetting and always degrading when they say they zoned out. I know that they probably aren’t doing it on purpose and that they probably think I just look at it like it’s a joke but sometimes it actually does hurt my feelings a bit. I wish I didn’t care this much but it’s hard not to."

 My(19M) girlfriend(19F) is a very private person. She never posts anything on social media, and usually she tends to be very secretive, like I found that she kind of drives conversations towards talking about me, and my interests. But it’s really hard to learn more about her because she doesn’t let me. She’s like this everyone except for her best friend Marie.

Above all else, she is super super possessive about her phone, she’s never showed me any of her photos or anything, she always takes her phone with her, she has one of those advanced passcodes, and she always turns her phone away from my direction, and just acts a little sus in general.

This has caused me lots of mental torture, as I don’t know what’s going on, if she even likes me, I keep on thinking I’m not good enough for her, and it just feels weird that she’s so cautious around me."

 So we talked, and I cried a bit but explained how I felt, asked how he felt and if there was any more to this than he was telling me. He assured me there wasn’t, and he is just worried because he wants us & our kids especially to have the best possible day, and he just feels these things are red flags that we could be paying for a wedding that is sub par and he feels I deserve the best.

He isn’t always the best at communicating verbally, sometimes just saying stuff in a way that sounds really blunt and doesn’t realise at the time that some people (like me) won’t understand the meaning behind his words unless he says it which sometimes causes panic in me bc I need context.

My fiancé is very sweet, but he just kind of assumes that bc I know him, I must of course know that he would never get cold feet about marrying me and that he wants to give me the moon on a stick- and therefore there is no possible way I could misunderstand the words ‘I need to think about if I want to get married there’ as him suggesting we postpone due to cold feet…

Chat I love this big doofus :’) thank you for all your responses I appreciate them all

So, I will start by saying I love this man so much, for so many reasons. He is my muse, my confidant, he encourages me and builds my confidence, I have never felt so free as I do now bc he not only isn’t controlling but encourages me to go live my own life too so I go on holiday with my friends sometimes rather than just with him, plenty of nights out etc. He stands up for me, he is an amazing Dad to his and my kid, he is a bit fruity and gay which is great bc so am I, he is safe, he smells good, like I could list so many things I love about him. We don’t argue- we talk stuff out.

But last night he started looking through the latest email from the wedding venue that I forwarded and now- 3 months before the wedding, he is saying he’s unhappy with loads of stuff that he wishes he’d known before we booked it, such as the fact there aren’t toilets so they use portaloos (it is a historical site and listed so I understand this) and that the sound system only uses a spotify playlist. He asked how much I paid for the deposit (I paid that and he paid for other stuff we are going halves on the wedding) and suggested he might want to postpone it and find another venue. I feel like we’ve it’s too late to stop now because we’ve already put in so much. Chat I am DEVASTATED. I honestly don’t give a single care about the portaloos or the sound system. I just want to get married to him and have a great day. The kids are excited, I have invited guests, I have a suit, I have a photographer, everything is in place.

It’s a small budget wedding, it’s only our little family and some close friends.

 AITA for backing out of a 15-minute favor when it suddenly turned into an hour-plus-long ordeal?
Context: I work from home two days per week; today is one of those days. My wife's workday ends at 4:00, mine ends at 5:30.

Today, when my wife got home (about 4:15), she called me downstairs pretty much as soon as she came in the front door, to tell me that she's left her car running and would I please take it over to Discount Tire (DT) because one of the tires is low. (For those not aware, DT provides complementary inflation and (non-sidewall) tire repairs.) Without complaint, I agree because it's only a 5-minute drive each way, so I can just take a quick 15-minute break from work. I drive her car down there, and the guy tops up 3 tires, but on the 4th his machine won't dispense any air. I see him check it with a manual pressure gauge and then he comes up to the window and tells me that the tire is under 15 PSI, so he can't inflate it, but he says they're not very busy right now, they could repair the tire after only about a half-hour wait. I let him know that I need to get back to work, is there any way he can add even a little bit of air so I can maybe have my wife bring it back and wait? He says no, because it's ""basically flat"".

I call my wife to let her know this - my intention is to ask her if I drive back home, would she want to drive it back to DT now since the wait is relatively short (when they're busy, it can be a 2+hour wait), or if not I can at least make an appointment while I'm here. But I don't even get that far; she just wants me to stay and wait for it (even though she's already done working for the day). I tell her I really need to get back to work, and she gets very upset. I ask DT Guy what exactly he meant by ""basically flat"" and he said I'm at 13 PSI. I confirm with him that this means I'm not at immediate risk of the rim tearing up the inside of the tire if I drive it back home right now, so I tell my wife that I'm coming back and I'll be there in 5 minutes. As I'm driving home I get a couple of texts, including ""I'll just have you drive me to work tomorrow and my car can sit in the f***ing driveway for all I care"", but of course I don't read them until I get home.

I go inside to make another attempt to explain the specifics of the situation (I haven't even been able to tell her that it's not actually flat flat, yet), but she refuses to listen to a word of it, telling me she isn't going to listen to anything I have to say for the next week, and that I've ""ruined everything"".

I don't recall every word exchanged, but I know I did tell her that she was acting like a child, and in the end saying ""Fine, I'll go back there and I'll just have to work until 8pm tonight!"" to which she responded with ""Good, I don't want to see you!""

I did go back to DT, and started composing this post while waiting.

AITA?

Editing to answer some common questions.

We do own a portable air compressor, it takes about 5 minutes for it to fill one tire, and it's in the trunk of her car.
Taking care of car things is my chore, but every time she's asked me to inflate her tires I have done so - I wasn't neglecting them. Also, the last time I put air in, I told her that she needs to make a trip to DT after work ASAP (because I work until 5:30 and DT closes at 6:00) to get that tire checked for damage, since it loses air faster than the others.
She is generally in charge of discretionary spending, so if the tire had needed to be replaced (repairs are free at DT), she would need to be there to compare the options available.
DT is the opposite direction from home as her work, that's probably why she didn't go there on her way home from work.
She didn't drive my car to DT because we only have one key for it, and it didn't occur to me to take it out of my pocket before leaving.
No, she is not like this all the time."

 First off English is not my first language so forgive my mistakes if any.

Long story short, I have a friend let's call her H who proposed we get together, I was down and started saving up for Money to contribute. She told me we'd be 12 girls in total, most are her friends I've met before but we're not close but I was fine with it since I was looking forward to making new friends.

Days later we agreed on an amount to contribute per person, we also agreed that after everyone contributes we will make a budget together keeping in mind people's allergies or diet restrictions.

Then on Monday H texted me and sent a document of the budget? I was shocked but still opened it and I found a lot of the food there were things I cannot eat due to allergies and food restrictions. I asked her about it and she answered that the majority agreed with those things and that I should get over it and that i can just eat the other things there.

I thought about it and decided I wouldn't go, and here's were I was called the asshole,I asked for my money back since I wasn't going to be attending. H and her friends are calling me a petty person because me backing out will do damage to their budget and so on. But I don't see the problem here, so reddit am I really being unreasonable here??"

 I am 19 female and I have a boyfriend who comes every saturday night to have dinner with my family and me. My family were downstairs talking and waiting for me, I showered and went downstairs. My shoes were a bit wet but no big deal according to me. My dad saw that a few drops fell in the floor (literally a few drops) and said that I am so disgusting and I have to clean the floor now. I quietly took a mop and cleaned the floor while my dad was talking to my boyfriend about how bad I am and disgustingly dirty person that he will realize this once we marry. I would normally respond to a comment like that but I was numb, I took my things and put the mop in its place and went uo to my room and locked myself to cry. My boyfriend made up an excuse and left. Was I an asshole? Childish? Should I have stayed?

 Recently, I [25m] was visiting some family, including my cousin [28f], who has a PhD in computer science— relevant later.

For some background info, growing up, I was always seen as the ‘smart’ one in the family, which she resented me for due to wanting that title herself. She was a lot more studious than I am, and got a PhD, whereas I ended my schooling after my bachelors due to not liking specialization. I’m currently a filmmaker that has been surprisingly successful, and she works at a hedge fund doing quant work.

Regarding my opinion on her, I think she’s quite smart in her niche. However, she lacks what I see as traits of a more generalized intelligence— being quick witted, adaptable, open minded, and exploratory. Every truly intelligent person I’ve ever met has been funny and a genuinely interesting person, and I don’t see that in her. She’s more what I would call a ‘sweat’— she works hard, and is talented in her niche, but lacking the originality to be truly intelligent.

Anyhow, when I visited my family, she began needling me about how now she has her PhD (the last time I had seen her, she was still in her program) I had to admit that she was smarter than me. I shrugged it off mostly, but she began demanding that I ‘admit’ she’s smarter than her, so I responded that PhD or no PhD, I don’t think she’s exceptionally intelligent or more intelligent than I am.

This caused her to fly off the handle, and she started yelling that I was just a jealous AH who couldn’t accept that a woman was smarter than her. She furthered that she was confident and secure in the fact she was more intelligent than I was.

I pointed out that if she was so secure in her own intelligence, my disputing it wouldn’t bother her that much, and the fact she needed me to validate her shows she’s not particularly confident. She just got angry again, called me an AH, and stormed off.

AITA? I think she shouldn’t have started a conversation about her intelligence if She just wanted me to sing her praises"

 so i was just trying to have a chill night. did some pilates to decompress a bit. and then my boyfriend decides to go on a full hour-long rant about how much he hates rachel zegler — like, actual anger, showing me videos, replaying clips, all of it. because apparently… her facial expressions are annoying. she’s “full of herself,” “too smug,” “laughs too loud,” “thinks she’s smart,” and the biggest sin of all — she said the original snow white was scary when she was a kid.

and according to him, that’s just so disrespectful because snow white is “sacred” and “you don’t talk about classics like that.” dude. she said a movie scared her when she was little. that’s it.

and the whole time i’m just sitting there like… ok this feels off. like this is not about rachel zegler. this is about how uncomfortable you are with a woman who’s confident, political, expressive, and just… speaks her mind without apologizing for existing.

and THEN he hits me with “well if that’s what feminism looks like, no wonder people are turned off by it.” like it’s her job to make feminism cute and likable for dudes. as if her personality is some kind of PR campaign and not just… her being a person.

and then the best part — he tells me that i don’t actually like her either. that i’m only defending her because she’s feminist and that deep down i must find her annoying too. like??? sorry for having my own opinion i guess??

idk. i feel drained. the convo stressed me out more than my actual workout. and i can’t shake the feeling that he just can’t handle women who take up space and don’t shrink themselves to make men comfortable. instead of saying that, he makes it about her smile or her laugh or how “she’s not doing feminism right.”

am i overreacting? or is this just the most textbook patriarchal nonsense ever??"
