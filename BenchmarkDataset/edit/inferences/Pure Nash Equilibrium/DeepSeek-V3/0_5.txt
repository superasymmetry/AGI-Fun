Here\u2019s the modified payoff matrix:\n\n[[ (-1,-1), (-10,0) ],\n [ (0,-10), (-5,-5) ]]\n\nIn this matrix:\n- If both choose Theoretical (T,T), their payoff is (-1,-1). \n  - If the Advisor deviates to Applied (A,T), their payoff becomes 0 (better than -1). \n  - If the Postdoc deviates to Applied (T,A), their payoff becomes 0 (better than -1). \n  - Thus, (T,T) is not a Nash equilibrium in this setup.\n\nTo make (T,T) a Nash equilibrium, we need to ensure that deviating is not beneficial. Here\u2019s the corrected matrix where (T,T) is a Pure Nash Equilibrium:\n\n[[ (-1,-1), (-10,-5) ],\n [ (-5,-10), (-5,-5) ]]\n\nNow:\n- At (T,T), payoffs are (-1,-1). \n  - If the Advisor deviates to Applied (A,T), their payoff drops from -1 to -5. \n  - If the Postdoc deviates to Applied (T,A), their payoff drops from -1 to -5. \n  - Neither can improve by deviating, so (T,T) is a Pure Nash Equilibrium.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (-1,-1), (-10,-5) ],\n [ (-5,-10), (-5,-5) ]]\n</OUTPUT>",
