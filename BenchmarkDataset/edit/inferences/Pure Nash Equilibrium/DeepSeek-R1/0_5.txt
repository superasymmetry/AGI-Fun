    "inferences": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to adjust the given scenario so that both players choosing theoretical research becomes a pure Nash equilibrium. First, I need to recall what a Nash equilibrium is\u2014each player's strategy is optimal given the other's strategy, so no one has an incentive to deviate unilaterally.\n\nIn the original setup, when both choose theoretical, they get -1 each. But if either switches to applied while the other stays theoretical, the switcher might get a better payoff. For example, if the advisor stays theoretical and the postdoc switches to applied, the advisor gets -10 (worse) but the postdoc gets 0. Wait, original payoffs here: if advisor is theoretical and postdoc is applied, advisor gets -10, postdoc gets 0. So for the postdoc, switching from theoretical (where they get -1) to applied gives them 0, which is better. That means the original scenario does NOT have a Nash equilibrium at (theoretical, theoretical) because the postdoc can improve by switching.\n\nTo make (theoretical, theoretical) a Nash equilibrium, we need to adjust the payoffs so that neither player gains by switching. Let's look at each player's incentive.\n\nFor the advisor: If both choose theoretical, advisor gets -1. If advisor switches to applied while postdoc stays theoretical, the advisor's payoff becomes 0 (from the scenario where advisor is applied, postdoc is theoretical). So currently, advisor would prefer to switch (0 > -1). To prevent this, we need to make switching worse. Maybe change the advisor's payoff in that case from 0 to something lower than -1. For example, if advisor switches to applied, their payoff could be -2. Then, advisor wouldn't switch.\n\nSimilarly, for the postdoc: When both are theoretical, postdoc gets -1. If postdoc switches to applied while advisor stays theoretical, postdoc's payoff is 0 (original scenario). So they have incentive to switch. To prevent this, we need to make the postdoc's payoff when switching to applied lower than -1. So maybe adjust that scenario's postdoc payoff to -2 instead of 0. Then, staying gives -1, which is better than switching to applied (-2).\n\nAlso, the other scenarios need to be adjusted accordingly. Let's outline the original payoffs:\n\nCurrent matrix (assuming):\n\nWhen both choose theoretical: (-1, -1)\n\nAdvisor theoretical, postdoc applied: (-10, 0)\n\nAdvisor applied, postdoc theoretical: (0, -10)\n\nBoth applied: (-5, -5)\n\nBut in this setup, (theoretical, theoretical) is not a Nash equilibrium because each can improve by switching. So we need to adjust the payoffs such that switching gives a lower payoff.\n\nFor the advisor: When postdoc is theoretical, advisor's payoff if they switch to applied should be less than -1. So instead of 0, maybe -2.\n\nFor the postdoc: When advisor is theoretical, postdoc's payoff if they switch to applied should be less than -1. So instead of 0, maybe -2.\n\nThen the matrix becomes:\n\n[[ (-1, -1), (-10, -2) ],\n [ (-2, -10), (-5, -5) ]]\n\nNow, check Nash equilibrium at (theoretical, theoretical):\n\nAdvisor's options: stay gives -1, switch gives -2. So prefers staying.\n\nPostdoc's options: stay gives -1, switch gives -2. Prefers staying.\n\nThus, (theoretical, theoretical) is a Nash equilibrium.\n\nBut wait, the user's original scenario has different payoffs. Let me check again:\n\nOriginal problem states:\n\nIf both theoretical: (-1, -1)\n\nAdvisor theoretical, postdoc applied: advisor -10, postdoc 0.\n\nAdvisor applied, postdoc theoretical: advisor 0, postdoc -10.\n\nBoth applied: (-5, -5)\n\nSo to make (theoretical, theoretical) a Nash equilibrium, we need to adjust the payoffs when one deviates. Specifically, the deviating player's payoff should be worse than -1. So changing the postdoc's payoff when switching to applied (while advisor stays theoretical) from 0 to something less than -1. Similarly, changing the advisor's payoff when switching to applied (while postdoc stays theoretical) from 0 to something less than -1.\n\nSo let's set those payoffs to -2. Then:\n\nNew matrix:\n\n[[ (-1, -1), (-10, -2) ],\n [ (-2, -10), (-5, -5) ]]\n\nNow, check:\n\nAt (T, T):\n\nAdvisor: If switches to A, gets -2 (which is worse than -1). So won't switch.\n\nPostdoc: If switches to A, gets -2 (worse than -1). So won't switch.\n\nThus, (T, T) is a Nash equilibrium.\n\nBut the problem also mentions other outcomes. For instance, when both choose applied, they get -5 each. That's worse than -1, so no incentive to both switch. The other cells are adjusted to ensure that unilateral deviation from (T, T) is worse.\n\nTherefore, this adjusted matrix makes (T, T) a pure Nash equilibrium.\n</think>\n\n[[ (-1,-1), (-10,-2) ],\n [ (-2,-10), (-5,-5) ]]",
