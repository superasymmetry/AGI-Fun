I'll modify the payoffs to create a cyclical pattern of best responses, similar to a \"Rock, Paper, Scissors\" dynamic.\n\nLet's think about it:\n1. When Dog A Fetches and Dog B Chases:\n   - Dog A gets 3 points (enjoys the activity)\n   - Dog B gets 2 points (enjoys chasing)\n\n2. When Dog A Fetches and Dog B Rests:\n   - Dog A gets 1 point (solo play)\n   - Dog B gets 3 points (prefers rest when other is fetching)\n\n3. When Dog A Stays and Dog B Chases:\n   - Dog A gets 2 points (enjoys watching)\n   - Dog B gets 1 point (wastes energy)\n\n4. When Dog A Stays and Dog B Rests:\n   - Dog A gets 3 points (prefers rest when other rests)\n   - Dog B gets 2 points (enjoys companionship)\n\nThis creates a cycle where there's always an incentive for one dog to change their strategy, preventing any Pure Nash Equilibrium.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[(3,2), (1,3)],\n [(2,1), (3,2)]]",
