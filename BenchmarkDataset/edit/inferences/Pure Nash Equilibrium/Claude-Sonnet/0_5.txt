Let's adjust the payoffs:\n\nWhen both focus on theoretical research:\n- They publish a high-impact theoretical paper (5,5)\n(Changed from negative to positive to make it beneficial)\n\nWhen advisor wants theoretical but postdoc wants applied:\n- Advisor is dissatisfied (-2,0)\n(Reduced penalty to make theoretical more attractive)\n\nWhen advisor wants applied but postdoc wants theoretical:\n- Postdoc struggles (0,-2)\n(Reduced penalty but kept it negative)\n\nWhen both focus on applied:\n- They produce mediocre results (1,1)\n(Made it positive but less attractive than theoretical)\n\nNow, let's verify this is a Pure Nash Equilibrium when both choose theoretical:\n1. If advisor unilaterally deviates to applied while postdoc stays theoretical: Gets 0 instead of 5 (no incentive)\n2. If postdoc unilaterally deviates to applied while advisor stays theoretical: Gets 0 instead of 5 (no incentive)\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[(5,5), (-2,0)],\n [(0,-2), (1,1)]]",
