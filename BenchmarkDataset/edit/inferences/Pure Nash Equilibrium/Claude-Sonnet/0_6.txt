I'll modify the given scenario.\n\nLet's analyze first: To eliminate Pure Nash Equilibrium, we need to ensure that no cell in the matrix represents a situation where neither player can unilaterally improve their payoff by changing their strategy.\n\nLet's make it so that:\n1. When both choose Commercial: (-1,-1)\n2. When Artist=Commercial, Agent=Personal: (-10,0)\n3. When Artist=Personal, Agent=Commercial: (0,-10)\n4. When both choose Personal: (-5,-5)\n\nLooking at this matrix:\n- If both are at Commercial (-1,-1), the Artist would want to switch to Personal (0 > -1)\n- If both are at Personal (-5,-5), both would want to switch to Commercial\n- If they're mismatched, the one with the -10 would want to switch\n\nThis creates a cyclical pattern where there's no stable position, eliminating any Pure Nash Equilibrium.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (-1,-1), (-10,0) ],\n [ (0,-10), (-5,-5) ]]",
