Both players have clear best responses to each other's strategies\n2. There will be a Pure Nash Equilibrium where neither player wants to deviate\n\nIn this modified version, there is a Pure Nash Equilibrium when one player hunts and the other rests, as:\n- The hunting player has no incentive to switch to resting (would reduce payoff from 10 to 2)\n- The resting player has no incentive to switch to hunting (would reduce payoff from 0 to 5)\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (5,5),    (10,0)  ],\n [ (0,10),   (2,2)   ]]",
