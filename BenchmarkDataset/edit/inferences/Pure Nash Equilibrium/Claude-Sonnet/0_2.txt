    "inferences": "Let me help modify this scenario to remove the Pure Nash Equilibrium.\n\nIn the original scenario, when Person A apologizes and Person B forgives, neither player has an incentive to unilaterally deviate, making it a Pure Nash Equilibrium (both get +1).\n\nTo remove this Pure Nash Equilibrium, we can modify the payoffs so that at least one player always has an incentive to deviate from any strategy combination. Here's my thought process:\n\n1. Let's change the payoff when both cooperate (Apologize/Forgive) so that Person B would prefer to stay angry\n2. We'll make it so that when Person A apologizes, Person B gets more points by staying angry (2 points instead of 1)\n3. We'll adjust other payoffs to ensure there's no Pure Nash Equilibrium anywhere\n\nLet's create a matrix where players always want to switch their strategy:\n\nIf A apologizes:\n- When B forgives (1,1), B would prefer to stay angry (\u22121,2)\nIf A stays silent:\n- When B forgives (\u22121,1), A would prefer to apologize (1,1)\n- When B stays angry (1,\u22121), B would prefer to forgive (\u22121,1)\n\nThis creates a cyclical pattern where there's always an incentive to change strategy.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (1,1), (-1,2) ],\n [ (-1,1), (1,-1) ]]",
