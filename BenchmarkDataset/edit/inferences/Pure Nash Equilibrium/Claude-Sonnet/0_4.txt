Let's modify the payoffs to create a cyclical preference pattern:\n\n1. Both go to park: Let's make this (3,1)\n- Twin A gets more enjoyment\n- Twin B still enjoys it but less\n\n2. Both stay home: Let's make this (1,3)\n- Now Twin B gets more enjoyment\n- Twin A enjoys it but less\n\n3. A goes to park, B stays home: Keep as (0,2)\n4. A stays home, B goes to park: Keep as (2,0)\n\nThis creates a cycle where:\n- If both are at park (3,1), B wants to deviate to home\n- If A at park, B at home (0,2), A wants to deviate to home\n- If both at home (1,3), A wants to deviate to park\n- If A at home, B at park (2,0), B wants to deviate to home\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[(3,1), (0,2)],\n [(2,0), (1,3)]]",
