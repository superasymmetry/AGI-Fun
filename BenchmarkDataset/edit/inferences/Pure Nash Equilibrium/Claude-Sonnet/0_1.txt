Let's modify the payoffs to create this situation:\n\nModified Scenario:\n- When Acrobat performs High Dive and Clown prepares Safety Net: Both create an exciting show\n(Acrobat gets 5, Clown gets 5)\n\n- When Acrobat performs High Dive and Clown stays Idle: Dangerous situation!\n(Acrobat gets -2, Clown gets -2)\n\n- When Acrobat does Nothing and Clown prepares Safety Net: Waste of effort\n(Acrobat gets 0, Clown gets -1)\n\n- When Acrobat does Nothing and Clown stays Idle: Both save energy\n(Acrobat gets 1, Clown gets 1)\n\nThis creates a Pure Nash Equilibrium when both performers coordinate (High Dive, Safety Net) because:\n- Acrobat won't deviate from High Dive when Clown has Safety Net (5 > 0)\n- Clown won't deviate from Safety Net when Acrobat does High Dive (5 > -2)\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (5,5),  (-2,-2) ],\n [ (0,-1), (1,1)   ]]",
