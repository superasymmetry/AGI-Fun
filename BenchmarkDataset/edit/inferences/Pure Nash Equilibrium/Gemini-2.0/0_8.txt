    "inferences": "To eliminate a Pure Nash Equilibrium, we need to make it so that in *every* possible outcome, at least one player has an incentive to switch their strategy.  Here's how we can modify the payoff matrix to achieve this:\n\n**Modified Payoff Matrix:**\n\n|             | Bat Hunts | Bat Rests |\n|-------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Owl Hunts   |   0, 0   | 10, -10  |\n| Owl Rests   | -10, 10  | -5, -5 |\n\n**Explanation of Changes and Why it Eliminates Pure Nash Equilibria:**\n\n*   **(Hunt, Hunt) Now Unstable:** In the original game, (Hunt, Hunt) was a Nash Equilibrium. Now, if both the owl and bat are hunting, they each receive 0. If the owl switches to Resting, it receives -10 while the bat still hunts. If the bat switches to Resting, it receives -10 while the owl still hunts. If they BOTH switch to resting, they each receive -5. Thus, NEITHER have an incentive to unilaterally switch since they both receive less.\n\n*   **(Hunt, Rest) and (Rest, Hunt) Still Unstable:** As before, if the owl hunts and the bat rests, the owl gets +10, and the bat gets -10. The bat is incentivized to switch to hunting since they will get 0 instead of -10. As before, if the bat hunts and the owl rests, the bat gets +10, and the owl gets -10. The owl is incentivized to switch to hunting since they will get 0 instead of -10.\n\n*   **(Rest, Rest) Also Unstable:** If the owl and bat are both resting, they each receive -5. If the owl unilaterally switches to hunting, they receive -10, while if the bat unilaterally switches to hunting, they receive -10. If they BOTH unilaterally switch to hunting, they receive 0. Thus, NEITHER have an incentive to unilaterally switch since they both receive less.\n\n**Why No Pure Nash Equilibrium Exists:**\n\nNo matter what combination of strategies the owl and bat choose, *one* of them (or both) will always have an incentive to switch. This creates a dynamic where the players are constantly tempted to change their behavior, preventing any stable equilibrium from forming.\n\n**In Summary:**\n\nBy altering the payoffs, specifically making the reward for (Hunt, Hunt) less than the reward for one player hunting alone while the other rests, we removed all the Pure Nash Equilibria from the game. The crucial aspect is ensuring that in *every* possible outcome, a player benefits from changing their strategy, thereby preventing a stable equilibrium.\n",
