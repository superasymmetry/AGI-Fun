    "inferences": "To change the given scenario so that both twins staying home is not a Pure Nash Equilibrium, we need to modify the payoffs such that at least one twin has an incentive to deviate from staying home when the other twin stays home.\n\nIn the original scenario, both twins staying home results in -5 points for each, and both twins going to the park results in -1 point for each. If one twin goes to the park and the other stays home, the twin going to the park gets -10 points and the twin staying home gets 0 points.\n\nLet's modify the payoffs so that if both twins stay home, they get 0 points each (instead of -5), and if one twin goes to the park while the other stays home, the twin going to the park gets -5 points (instead of -10) and the twin staying home gets 5 points (instead of 0). If both twins go to the park, they still get -1 point each.\n\nHere is the modified payoff matrix:\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (0,0), (-5,5) ],\n [ (5,-5), (-1,-1) ]]",
