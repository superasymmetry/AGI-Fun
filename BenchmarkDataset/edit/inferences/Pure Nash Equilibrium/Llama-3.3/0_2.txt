    "inferences": "To change the given example so that it is not an instance of the Pure Nash Equilibrium, we need to adjust the payoffs so that at least one player has an incentive to deviate from the current strategy, given the other player's strategy.\n\nIn the original example, when Person A apologizes and Person B forgives, both receive +1 point. This is a Pure Nash Equilibrium because neither player can improve their payoff by unilaterally changing their strategy, assuming the other player's strategy remains the same.\n\nLet's modify the payoffs so that Person A apologizes and Person B forgives is no longer a Pure Nash Equilibrium. We can do this by changing the payoff for Person A when they apologize and Person B forgives to a lower value, or by changing the payoff for Person B when they forgive and Person A apologizes to a lower value.\n\nFor example, let's say that when Person A apologizes and Person B forgives, Person A now receives 0 points instead of +1 point. This could represent a situation where Person A feels that apologizing is the right thing to do, but they don't necessarily feel better about the relationship.\n\nHere is the modified payoff matrix:\n\n[[ (0,1), (-1,1) ],\n [ (-1,1), (1,-1) ]]\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (0,1), (-1,1) ],\n [ (-1,1), (1,-1) ]]",
