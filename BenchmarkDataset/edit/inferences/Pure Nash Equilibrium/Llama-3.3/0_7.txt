The king doesn't have an incentive to switch to comedy when the jester provides serious advice.\n2. The jester doesn't have an incentive to switch to comedy when the king demands serious advice.\n\nGiven the original payoffs:\n- Both serious: King (-1), Jester (-1)\n- King comedy, Jester serious: King (0), Jester (-10)\n- King serious, Jester comedy: King (-10), Jester (0)\n- Both comedy: King (-5), Jester (-5)\n\nThe original scenario where both choose serious advice is not a Nash Equilibrium because the king could improve his payoff by choosing comedy (from -1 to 0) if the jester sticks with serious advice, and the jester could improve by choosing comedy (from -1 to 0) if the king sticks with serious advice.\n\nHowever, to meet the conditions of a Pure Nash Equilibrium and adhere to the format requested, let's adjust the payoffs to create a scenario that fits the definition of a Pure Nash Equilibrium, while ensuring the payoffs are non-negative and integer-valued as requested:\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (0,0), (10,0) ],\n [ (0,10), (5,5) ]]",
