    "inferences": "To change the given example so that it is not an instance of the Pure Nash Equilibrium, we need to modify the payoffs such that no single strategy combination is the best response for both players, regardless of what the other player chooses. \n\nIn the original example, if both hunt, they both get +10. If one hunts and the other rests, the hunter gets +10 and the rester gets -10. If both rest, they both get 0. This creates a situation where hunting is the dominant strategy for both, as they both receive a higher payoff by hunting regardless of the other's action, leading to a Pure Nash Equilibrium where both choose to hunt.\n\nTo avoid this, let's adjust the payoffs so that the best response for one player depends on the action of the other player. For instance, we could make the payoff for both resting higher than the payoff for one hunting and the other resting, but lower than the payoff for both hunting. However, to truly avoid a Pure Nash Equilibrium, we need to ensure there's no single best response for each player that doesn't depend on the other's choice.\n\nLet's modify the payoffs as follows: If both hunt, they both get +5. If the owl hunts and the bat rests, the owl gets +8 but the bat gets -5. If the owl rests and the bat hunts, the bat gets +8 but the owl gets -5. If both rest, they both get +3.\n\nThis setup means that if the bat hunts, the owl's best response is to rest (to get -5 instead of +5), and if the bat rests, the owl's best response is to hunt (to get +8 instead of +3). Similarly, from the bat's perspective, if the owl hunts, the bat's best response is to rest (to get -5 instead of +5), and if the owl rests, the bat's best response is to hunt (to get +8 instead of +3). This interdependence of strategies means there's no pure strategy that is a best response regardless of the other player's action, thus avoiding a Pure Nash Equilibrium.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (5,5), (8,-5) ],\n [ (-5,8), (3,3) ]]",
