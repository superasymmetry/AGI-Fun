    "inferences": "In the given scenario, you are asked to modify the example to ensure it does not represent a Pure Nash Equilibrium. A Pure Nash Equilibrium occurs when each player's strategy choice is optimal given the strategy of the other player, and no player can benefit by unilaterally changing their strategy.\n\nTo achieve this, we need to alter the payoffs such that either the player or both players would benefit by switching their strategy when both invest in personal projects.\n\nThe current scenario's payoffs are:\n\n- Both focus on commercial work: (-1, -1)\n- Artist chooses commercial work, Agent chooses personal projects: (-10, 0)\n- Artist chooses personal projects, Agent chooses commercial work: (0, -10)\n- Both focus on personal projects: (-5, -5)\n\nIn this matrix, neither player benefits by unilaterally changing their strategy when both invest in personal projects, making it a Pure Nash Equilibrium.\n\nTo modify this, adjust the payoffs when both focus on personal projects, so that at least one player has an incentive to change their decision. For example, change the payoff when both focus on personal projects to (-6, -4). This way, the Artist has an incentive to switch to commercial work since receiving a payoff of -1 is better than -6. This deviation breaks the Nash Equilibrium.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (-1,-1), (-10,0) ],\n [ (0,-10), (-6,-4) ]]\n<OUTPUT>",
