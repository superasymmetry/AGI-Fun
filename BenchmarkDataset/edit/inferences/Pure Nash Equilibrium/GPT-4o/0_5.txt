    "inferences": "To create an instance of the Pure Nash Equilibrium, let's construct a payoff matrix where at least one strategy combination is such that neither player can improve their payoff by unilaterally deviating from their current strategy. In the given scenario, it doesn't appear that both focusing on theoretical research is a Nash equilibrium, as both players can switch to focusing on applied research to improve their payoffs.\n\nLet\u2019s modify the payoffs to ensure that there exists a pure Nash equilibrium. The new payoffs should be such that when both players choose a particular strategy combination, neither can increase their payoff by changing strategies individually. Here is a new version of the payoff matrix:\n\n- If both focus on theoretical research, they both earn 2 points, as their expertise leads to high-quality publications.\n- If the advisor focuses on theoretical while the postdoc goes for applied, the advisor receives 0 points as their objectives aren't aligned, and the postdoc receives 1 point for some valuable experience.\n- If the advisor focuses on applied and the postdoc on theoretical, the advisor receives 1 point for some practical insights but the postdoc receives 0 points.\n- If both focus on applied research, they both receive 3 points for producing impactful research.\n\nWith these adjusted payoffs, the strategy of both focusing on applied research becomes a Pure Nash Equilibrium because neither player benefits from changing their strategy unilaterally. \n\nLet's write the payoff matrix reflecting these conditions.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (2,2), (0,1) ],\n [ (1,0), (3,3) ]]\n",
