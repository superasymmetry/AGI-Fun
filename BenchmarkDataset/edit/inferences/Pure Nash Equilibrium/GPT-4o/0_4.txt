Here is an adjustment where no strategy pair constitutes a Pure Nash Equilibrium:\n\nIf both twins go to the park, they have a great time playing together (+5 points each). If Twin A goes to the park but Twin B stays home, Twin A meets a new friend and enjoys her day (+3 points) while Twin B gets some rest (+2 points). If Twin B goes to the park but Twin A stays home, Twin B meets a new friend and enjoys her day (+3 points) while Twin A gets some rest (+2 points). If both twins stay home, they end up arguing over the remote but reconcile later, giving them a mix of good and bad experiences (0 points each). \n\nThis setup no longer yields a Pure Nash Equilibrium since every move could be improved by one player changing their strategy given what the other player is doing.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (5,5), (3,2) ],\n [ (2,3), (0,0) ]]\n<OUTPUT>",
