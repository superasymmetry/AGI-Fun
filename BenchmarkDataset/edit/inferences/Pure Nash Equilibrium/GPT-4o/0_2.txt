    "inferences": "To modify the given example so that it no longer contains a Pure Nash Equilibrium, we need to eliminate the scenario where both players can choose a strategy pair that is best for them given the other player's choice. This can be done by altering the payoffs in such a way that no strategy pair remains stable, meaning either player would have an incentive to change their strategy given the other's choice, creating continuous cycles of strategy shifts.\n\nOriginal Payoff Matrix:\n\n[[ (1, 1), (-1, 1) ],\n [ (-1, 1), (1, -1) ]]\n\nThis matrix is an instance of a Pure Nash Equilibrium because both players choosing the first strategy (Person A \"Apologizes\" and Person B \"Forgives\") yield the highest payoffs (1,1) for each, given the strategy of the other.\n\nTo eliminate the equilibrium, the payoffs should be modified so that neither (Apologize, Forgive) nor any other strategy pair remains optimal for both players simultaneously:\n\nFor example, if changing Person B's strategy yields a better result when Person A \"Apologizes\", then Person B would have no incentive to stay in their original strategy.\n\nThus:\n\nChange Payoff for (Apologize, Forgive): (0, 1)\n\nChange Payoff for (Apologize, Stay Angry): (0, 2)\n\nThis turns every cell into one where at least one player would benefit by changing their strategy.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (0, 1), (0, 2) ],\n [ (-1, 1), (1, -1) ]]\n",
