    "inferences": "To create an instance of a Pure Nash Equilibrium, we need to ensure that both players have strategies such that neither has anything to gain by changing only their own strategy unilaterally.\n\nThe previous scenario did not contain a Pure Nash Equilibrium because neither mutual hunting nor mutual resting provided a stable outcome where neither party would benefit from changing only their own choice. Let\u2019s adjust the payoff scenario:\n\n1. Let both rest, and both get a small benefit, meaning neither is hungry nor gets too tired by excessive hunting.\n2. Let the reward for both hunting remain the same, where both get a reward.\n3. Make one hunting while the other rests non-beneficial for the resting party, similar to before.\n4. Let the other player feel it\u2019s best to hunt when the opponent is resting.\n\nA Pure Nash Equilibrium must exist such that there is no incentive to change strategies whenever both players make their choice. Let\u2019s see how this should be presented in a payoff matrix:\n\n<OUTPUT>\n\n[[ (5,5), (0,0) ],\n [ (10,0), (0,10) ]]",
