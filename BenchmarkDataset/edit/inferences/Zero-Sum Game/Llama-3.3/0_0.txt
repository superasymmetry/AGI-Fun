    "inferences": "To change the given example so that it's not an instance of a Zero-Sum Game, we need to ensure that the sum of the payoffs for both players is not zero in at least one of the possible outcomes. In a Zero-Sum Game, one player's gain is equal to the other player's loss, resulting in a total payoff of zero for each outcome.\n\nLet's modify the game outcomes to make it non-zero-sum. We'll introduce a scenario where both players can gain something, or the total payoff is not zero.\n\nFor instance, if Artemis shoots from the left and Georgia blocks upwards, instead of neither scoring, let's say they both get a small bonus for a good defensive and offensive play, respectively. If Artemis shoots from the left and Georgia blocks downwards, Georgia still gets the advantage of blocking the shot, but now Artemis also gets a minor payoff for attempting a difficult shot.\n\nHere's how the modified game could look in terms of payoffs:\n\n- If Artemis shoots from the left and Georgia blocks upwards, both get +1.\n- If Artemis shoots from the left and Georgia blocks downwards, Georgia gets +2 (for successfully blocking), and Artemis gets +0.5 (for the attempt).\n- If Artemis shoots from the right and Georgia blocks upwards, both get +1.\n- If Artemis shoots from the right and Georgia blocks downwards, Georgia gets +2, and Artemis gets +0.5.\n\nThis setup ensures that the game is not zero-sum because the total payoff for some outcomes is not zero.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (1,1), (0.5,2) ],\n [ (1,1), (0.5,2) ]]",
