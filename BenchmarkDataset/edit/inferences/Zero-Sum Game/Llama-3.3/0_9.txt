Let's analyze the given outcomes and adjust them accordingly.\n\n1. Professor lectures and student studies: Initially, the professor gets +2 points and the student gets -2 points. This already sums to 0, so no adjustment is needed.\n2. Professor lectures and student listens: Initially, the professor gets +2 points and the student gets -2 points. This also sums to 0, so no adjustment is needed.\n3. Professor advises and student studies: Initially, the professor gets +4 points and the student gets -4 points. This sums to 0, so no adjustment is needed.\n4. Professor advises and student listens: Initially, the professor gets -1 points and the student gets -1 points. This sums to -2, not 0. To make it a zero-sum game, we can adjust the payoffs so that one player's gain equals the other's loss. For example, the professor could get +1 point and the student could get -1 point.\n\nNow, let's create the payoff matrix based on these adjusted outcomes.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (2, -2), (2, -2) ],\n [ (4, -4), (1, -1) ]]",
