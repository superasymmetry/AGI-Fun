Here's one possible way to do it:\n\n- If Michael plays the piano and Sara focuses on melody, Michael gains 1 point and Sara loses 1 point.\n- If Michael plays the piano and Sara focuses on rhythm, Michael loses 1 point and Sara gains 1 point.\n- If Michael plays the guitar and Sara focuses on melody, Michael gains 1 point and Sara loses 1 point.\n- If Michael plays the guitar and Sara focuses on rhythm, Michael loses 1 point and Sara gains 1 point.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (1,-1), (-1,1) ],\n [ (1,-1), (-1,1) ]]",
