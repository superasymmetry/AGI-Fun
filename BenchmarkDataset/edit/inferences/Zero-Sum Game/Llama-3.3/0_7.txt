    "inferences": "To convert the given example into a Zero-Sum Game, we need to ensure that the total payoff for each outcome is zero, meaning that one player's gain is equal to the other player's loss. \n\nLet's analyze the given outcomes and adjust them to meet the Zero-Sum Game criteria:\n\n1. If Harry casts Expelliarmus and Hermione uses Protego, Harry's spell hits first (+2 points) and Hermione's wand is knocked away from her (-3 points). To make this a zero-sum outcome, we can adjust the points to +2 for Harry and -2 for Hermione, resulting in a total payoff of 0.\n\n2. If Harry casts Expelliarmus and Hermione casts Petrificus Totalus, Hermione's spell reaches Harry first, binding him (-1 points to Harry and +1 points to Hermione). This outcome already has a total payoff of 0, so no adjustment is needed.\n\n3. If Harry casts Stupefy and Hermione uses Protego, Hermione blocks the Stunning Spell, maintaining her position. Hermione gets +1 points and Harry gets -1 points. This outcome already has a total payoff of 0, so no adjustment is needed.\n\n4. If Harry casts Stupefy and Hermione casts Petrificus Totalus, Harry's spell hits his target first (+3 to Harry, -3 to Hermione). This outcome already has a total payoff of 0, so no adjustment is needed.\n\nNow, let's create the payoff matrix:\n\nThe rows represent Harry's strategies (Expelliarmus and Stupefy), and the columns represent Hermione's strategies (Protego and Petrificus Totalus).\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (2, -2), (-1, 1) ],\n [ (-1, 1), (3, -3) ]]",
