A Zero-Sum Game is a game where one player's gain is equal to the other player's loss, resulting in a total payoff of zero for each outcome.\n\nLet's modify the payoffs as follows:\n\n- If Emma performs a magic trick and Olivia sings a song, Emma wows her audience (+2) and Olivia feels happy (+1) because she enjoys singing.\n- If Emma performs a magic trick and Olivia draws a picture, the parents become entranced with Olivia's artwork (+2) and Emma feels proud of her sister (+1).\n- If Emma tells a joke and Olivia sings a song, the joke falls flat (-1 to Emma) but Olivia gets words of affirmation (+2), and Emma is happy for her sister (+1).\n- If Emma tells a joke and Olivia draws a picture, Emma's joke goes tremendously well (+3 points!) and Olivia feels happy for Emma (+2).\n\nWith these modifications, the game is no longer a Zero-Sum Game because the total payoff for each outcome is not zero.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (2,1), (1,2) ],\n [ (-1,2), (3,2) ]]",
