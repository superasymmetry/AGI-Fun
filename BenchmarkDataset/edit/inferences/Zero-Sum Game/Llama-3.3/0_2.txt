    "inferences": "To change the given example so that it is not an instance of a Zero-Sum Game, we need to ensure that the total payoff for each outcome is not zero. In a Zero-Sum Game, one player's gain is equal to the other player's loss, resulting in a total payoff of zero for each outcome. \n\nLet's modify the payoffs so that the total payoff for each outcome is not zero. We can achieve this by introducing outcomes where both dogs gain or lose points, or where the points gained by one dog are not exactly equal to the points lost by the other.\n\nFor example, if Max barks and Bella jumps up, instead of the owner looking at Max (+1 point) and Bella feeling neglected (-1 point), the owner could look at both dogs and give them each some attention, resulting in +1 point for Max and -0.5 points for Bella because she was hoping for more attention. \n\nHere are the modified outcomes:\n\n- If Max barks and Bella jumps up, the owner looks at both dogs, giving Max +1 point and Bella +0.5 points because she's also getting some attention.\n- If Max barks and Bella rolls over, Bella gains the owner's attention for her cute trick (+1 point), and Max becomes slightly less frustrated (-0.5 points) because he sees Bella getting attention for a good behavior.\n- If Max sits quietly and Bella jumps up, only Bella gets love (+1 point), and Max feels a bit left out but not too bad (-0.5 points) because he's being calm.\n- If Max sits quietly and Bella rolls over, Max looks extra cute (+1 point), and Bella feels happy for Max (+0.5 points) because they're both being good.\n\nHere is the modified payoff matrix:\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (1, 0.5), (0.5, -0.5) ],\n [ (-0.5, 1), (1, 0.5) ]]",
