    "inferences": "To change the given example so that it's not an instance of a Zero-Sum Game, we need to modify the payoffs so that the sum of the payoffs for each possible combination of strategies is not zero. A Zero-Sum Game is defined as a game where one player's payoff is the negative of the other player's payoff, meaning that one player's gain is exactly equal to the other player's loss.\n\nLet's modify the payoffs as follows:\n\n- When Tiger employs claw and Monkey employs juggle, Tiger wins (+3) and Monkey loses (-2), resulting in a net gain of +1.\n- When Tiger employs claw and Monkey employs play, Tiger wins (+2) and Monkey loses (-1), resulting in a net gain of +1.\n- When Tiger employs bite and Monkey employs juggle, Tiger wins (+1) and Monkey loses (-1), resulting in a net gain of 0.\n- When Tiger employs bite and Monkey employs play, Tiger wins (+1) and Monkey loses (-1), but to make it non-zero sum, let's say Monkey also gains something, so Tiger wins (+1) and Monkey gains (+1), resulting in a net gain of +2.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (3,-2), (2,-1) ],\n [ (1,-1), (1,1) ]]",
