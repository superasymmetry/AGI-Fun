    "inferences": "To change the example so that it is not a zero-sum game, we need to make sure that the sum of the payoffs in at least some outcomes do not result in zero. In a zero-sum game, one player's gain is exactly the other player's loss. Here, let's modify the payoffs so that in some cases, both players can benefit, or both can suffer a loss, deviating from the strict condition where one player's gain must counterbalance the other's loss.\n\nConsider the following adjustments to the payoffs:\n\n1. A successful play where Artemis scores should result in positive payoffs for Artemis and possibly negative or neutral payoffs for Georgia. \n2. A failed block by Georgia that still results in a point for Artemis would mean positive payoff for Artemis, but no loss for Georgia beyond an opportunity cost.\n3. If both play well according to their strategies (e.g., Georgia blocks successfully or Artemis scores despite defense), players might gain some satisfaction (positive payoff) due to their good performance, or perhaps both might lose (negative payoff) due to being equally matched leading to a stalemate.\n\nLet's define these outcomes with example payoffs that reflect non-zero-sum interactions:\n\n- If Artemis shoots from the left and Georgia blocks upwards, Artemis might score by outmaneuvering Georgia (3, 1).\n- If Artemis shoots from the left and Georgia blocks downwards, perhaps Artemis still scores due to her skill, albeit with a risk of being injured (-1, -2).\n- If Artemis shoots from the right and Georgia blocks upwards, Georgia might fail to stop the shot leading to a surprise score for Artemis (2, 0).\n- If Artemis shoots from the right and Georgia blocks downwards, Georgia might block successfully (0, 2).\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (3, 1), (-1, -2) ],\n [ (2, 0), (0, 2) ]]\n<OUTPUT>",
