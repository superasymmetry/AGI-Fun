If Emma performs a magic trick and Olivia sings a song, Emma wows her audience (+2) and Olivia feels entertained as well (+1).\n2. If Emma performs a magic trick and Olivia draws a picture, the parents become entranced with Olivia's artwork (+1) and Emma appreciates it too (+1).\n3. If Emma tells a joke and Olivia sings a song, the joke falls flat (-1 to Emma) but Olivia feels encouraged (+2), as she finds the experience improves her singing confidence.\n4. If Emma tells a joke and Olivia draws a picture, Emma's joke goes tremendously well (+3 points!) but Olivia doesn't feel too bad because she sees it as a learning opportunity (0).\n\nThis way, the sum of the payoffs does not remain constant at zero, hence it is no longer a zero-sum game.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (2, 1), (1, 1) ],\n [ (-1, 2), (3, 0) ]]\n",
