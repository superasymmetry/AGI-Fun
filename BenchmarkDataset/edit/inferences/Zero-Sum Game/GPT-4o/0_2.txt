For instance, let's adjust the outcomes by allowing one or both dogs to gain a mutual benefit or face a mutual loss.\n\nHere are the adjusted outcomes:\n\n1. If Max barks and Bella jumps up, the owner looks at Max (+2 points) and Bella feels neglected (0 points).\n2. If Max barks and Bella rolls over, Bella gains the owner's attention (+1), while Max also gets extra points for his vocal enthusiasm (+1).\n3. If Max sits quietly and Bella jumps up, the owner finds both dogs' behavior adorable, giving both of them extra attention (+1 for Max, +2 for Bella).\n4. If Max sits quietly and Bella rolls over, the owner decides to ignore both, focusing on their phone instead (0 for both).\n\nNow let\u2019s create the payoff matrix that represents this updated game scenario:\n\n<OUTPUT>\n\n[[ (2,0), (1,1) ],\n [ (1,2), (0,0) ]]",
