    "inferences": "To transform this scenario into a zero-sum game, the sum of the payoffs for Mom and Emily in each possible outcome should be zero. Let's modify the payoffs accordingly. Here's a possible adjustment:\n\n- If Mom suggests going to the park and Emily pushes for watching a movie, Mom gets +2 (since she's happy to go outside first), and Emily gets -2.\n- If Mom suggests going to the park and Emily pushes for baking cookies, they continue to fight, so 0 is given to Mom and 0 to Emily.\n- If Mom suggests staying home and Emily pushes for watching a movie, Mom gets -1 (sluggish indoors) and Emily gets +1 (enjoys the movie).\n- If Mom suggests staying home and Emily pushes for baking cookies, Mom gets 0 (since she wanted to go outside), and Emily gets 0.\n\nTherefore, the resulting payoff matrix for this zero-sum game would look like this:\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (2,-2), (0,0) ],\n [ (-1,1), (0,0) ]]\n<OUTPUT>",
