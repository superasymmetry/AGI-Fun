    "inferences": "Here's the modified example to fit the definition of a zero-sum game, where one player's gain is exactly equivalent to the other player's loss:\n\n**Harry and Hermione are competing in a friendly duel to determine who is the superior duelist.**\n\nHarry has two strategies: cast a Disarming Charm (Expelliarmus) or cast a Stunning Spell (Stupefy).\nHermione has two strategies: cast a Shield Charm (Protego) or cast a Full Body-Bind Curse (Petrificus Totalus).\n\nThe outcomes, and most importantly, the scores, are now restructured to be truly zero-sum:\n\n*   **If Harry casts Expelliarmus and Hermione uses Protego:** Harry gains +2 points, and Hermione *loses* -2 points.\n\n*   **If Harry casts Expelliarmus and Hermione casts Petrificus Totalus:** Harry *loses* -1 points, and Hermione gains +1 points.\n\n*   **If Harry casts Stupefy and Hermione uses Protego:** Harry *loses* -1 point, and Hermione gains +1 point.\n\n*   **If Harry casts Stupefy and Hermione casts Petrificus Totalus:** Harry gains +3 points, and Hermione *loses* -3 points.\n\n**Explanation of Changes and Why it's now Zero-Sum:**\n\nThe crucial difference is that in each scenario, the points gained by one player are *exactly* the points lost by the other player.  The sum of their scores in each possible outcome is always zero.\n*   **Mathematical Representation (Payoff Matrix - Harry's perspective, positive numbers benefit Harry):**\n\n    |               | Hermione: Protego | Hermione: Petrificus Totalus |\n    | :------------ | :------------------ | :----------------------------- |\n    | Harry: Expelliarmus | +2                 | -1                              |\n    | Harry: Stupefy    | -1                  | +3                               |\n\n*   **Important:**  Hermione's payoff matrix would simply be the negative of this matrix (flipping all the signs).\n\n**Why this is Zero-Sum:**\n\nA zero-sum game is defined by the property that the total benefit to all players in the game for every combination of strategies always adds to zero.  No wealth or benefit is created or destroyed; it's merely transferred from one player to another. The modified example now satisfies this condition.",
