    "inferences": "Here's how to modify the game to be a zero-sum game:\n\nA cat and a mouse are playing a game of strategy in a kitchen.\n\nThe cat has two strategies: wait by the fridge or wait by the pantry. The mouse has two strategies: run for the cheese or run for the crackers. The game outcomes are as follows (with outcomes now representing the **cat's score**; the mouse's score is simply the negative of the cat's score):\n\n*   **Cat (Fridge), Mouse (Cheese):** The cat catches the mouse. The cat scores +1, and the mouse scores -1.\n*   **Cat (Fridge), Mouse (Crackers):** The cat only nips the mouse. The cat scores +0.5, and the mouse scores -0.5.\n*   **Cat (Pantry), Mouse (Cheese):** The cat nips a bit more of the mouse. The cat scores +0.75, and the mouse scores -0.75.\n*   **Cat (Pantry), Mouse (Crackers):** Both start thinking about the meaning of life and become pensive. The cat scores 0, and the mouse scores 0.\n\n**Explanation of Changes and Why it's now Zero-Sum:**\n\n*   **Focus on Cat's Payoff:** The key change is that we only explicitly define the cat's payoff. The mouse's payoff is *always* the negative of the cat's.\n*   **Zero-Sum Property:** In each outcome, the sum of the cat's score and the mouse's score is always zero. This is the defining characteristic of a zero-sum game:  One player's gain is exactly equal to the other player's loss.\n*   **Realistic Interpretation:** You can interpret the scores as representing things like:\n    *   Probability of the cat catching the mouse (0 to 1).\n    *   Amount of food the cat obtains (scaled appropriately).\n    *   Utility the cat gets (relative to the mouse's disutility).\n\nNow, the game is a *pure* zero-sum game.  Any strategy the cat employs to maximize its own score automatically minimizes the mouse's score (and vice versa).",
