    "inferences": "Here's the modified scenario to make it *not* a zero-sum game, focusing on the possibility of mutual benefit or loss:\n\n**Two animals \u2014 Tiger and Monkey\u2014 interact in the jungle. Tiger has two strategies: hunt and groom. Monkey has two strategies: gather and warn.**\n\n*   **Tiger (Hunt), Monkey (Gather):** Tiger gets food (+2), Monkey gets food (+1). Both benefit as Tiger's hunt benefits them both.\n*   **Tiger (Hunt), Monkey (Warn):** Tiger gets food (+2), Monkey is safe (+2). Tiger gets food, and Monkey is protected from predators.\n*   **Tiger (Groom), Monkey (Gather):** Tiger expends energy (-1), Monkey gets food (+1). Tiger uses energy, but monkey benefits from food.\n*   **Tiger (Groom), Monkey (Warn):** Tiger expends energy (-1), Monkey is safe (+2). Tiger uses energy, but Monkey benefits from being safe from predators.\n\n**Explanation of Changes and Why It's No Longer Zero-Sum:**\n\n1.  **Focus on Cooperation/Interdependence:** The actions are not purely competitive. They can now involve elements of cooperation or at least interdependent outcomes.\n\n2.  **Introduce External Factors:** The outcomes are not solely determined by the direct interaction of the two animals. Things like food availability (from the hunt) and safety from predators (from warnings) create separate benefits.\n\n3.  **Outcomes are not mirrored:** The benefits and losses are no longer equal and opposite. For instance, when Tiger hunts and Monkey gathers, both receive a positive benefit.\n\nIn this modified example, the sum of the payoffs for each outcome is not always zero. This is the key characteristic of a non-zero-sum game. Both players can potentially benefit (or both can potentially lose, although this example emphasizes the potential for mutual gain).\n",
