Michael has two strategies: play the piano or the guitar. Sara, as the judge, has two strategies: focus on melody or focus on rhythm.\n\nIf Michael plays the piano and Sara focuses on melody:\n- Michael gains 3 points (he's very good at piano melodies)\n- Sara loses 3 points (her strategy worked in Michael's favor)\n\nIf Michael plays the piano and Sara focuses on rhythm:\n- Michael loses 2 points (he's weaker at rhythmic piano playing)\n- Sara gains 2 points (her strategy successfully exposed Michael's weakness)\n\nIf Michael plays the guitar and Sara focuses on melody:\n- Michael loses 1 point (his melodic guitar playing is not as strong)\n- Sara gains 1 point (her strategy worked to reveal his weakness)\n\nIf Michael plays the guitar and Sara focuses on rhythm:\n- Michael gains 2 points (he's actually better at rhythmic guitar playing)\n- Sara loses 2 points (her strategy backfired)\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (3,-3), (-2,2) ],\n [ (-1,1), (2,-2) ]]",
