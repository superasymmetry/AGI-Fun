Deadlines + Coding: (0, 0) = 0\n\nTo make it non-zero-sum, I'll adjust the payoffs so they don't sum to zero, reflecting situations where both parties can benefit or lose to varying degrees:\n\n1. Research + Career: The advisor learns about Alex's goals (+2) and Alex gets some career perspective though not complete guidance (+1)\n2. Research + Coding: The advisor gets project updates (+1) and Alex gets some useful coding help (+2)\n3. Deadlines + Career: The advisor stays informed (+1) and Alex gets helpful career connections (+2)\n4.
