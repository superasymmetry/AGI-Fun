    "inferences": "Let me help transform this from a zero-sum game to a non-zero-sum game by modifying the payoffs to reflect situations where both players can potentially benefit or lose simultaneously.\n\nIn basketball, successful plays can actually benefit both players in different ways:\n- A good offensive play, even if defended well, can help both players improve their skills\n- A good defensive play can create learning opportunities for both players\n- Some outcomes can result in mutual benefits through practice and experience\n\nLet's modify the outcomes to reflect this:\n\n1. When Artemis shoots from left and Georgia blocks upwards:\n- Artemis gains practice points (+2)\n- Georgia improves her defensive positioning (+1)\n\n2. When Artemis shoots from left and Georgia blocks downwards:\n- Georgia gets a great block (+3)\n- Artemis learns from the experience (+1)\n\n3. When Artemis shoots from right and Georgia blocks upwards:\n- Both players gain good practice experience (+2 each)\n\n4. When Artemis shoots from right and Georgia blocks downwards:\n- Georgia makes an impressive block (+3)\n- Artemis gets feedback on her technique (+2)\n\nThis creates a non-zero-sum game because the sum of payoffs in each outcome is not zero, and some outcomes benefit both players.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (2,1), (2,2) ],\n [ (1,3), (2,3) ]]",
