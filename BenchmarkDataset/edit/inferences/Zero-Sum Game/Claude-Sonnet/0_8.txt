To change this, we'll adjust the payoffs so they don't sum to zero, which could represent a situation where both animals can potentially benefit or lose to varying degrees.\n\nLet's modify the scenario while keeping the same strategies:\n\nWhen Tiger uses claw and Monkey juggles:\n- Tiger gets +3 (still strong advantage)\n- Monkey gets -1 (less severe loss)\n\nWhen Tiger uses claw and Monkey plays:\n- Tiger gets +2\n- Monkey gets +1 (actually gains something from playing)\n\nWhen Tiger uses bite and Monkey juggles:\n- Tiger gets +1\n- Monkey gets +2 (gains more through successful juggling)\n\nWhen Tiger uses bite and Monkey plays:\n- Tiger gets +1\n- Monkey gets +1 (mutual benefit)\n\nThis creates situations where sometimes both animals can benefit, which is not possible in a zero-sum game.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[(3,-1), (2,1)],\n [(1,2), (1,1)]]",
