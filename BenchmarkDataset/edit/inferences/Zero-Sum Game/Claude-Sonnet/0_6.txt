First scenario (Magic Trick vs Sing):\nInstead of +2/-2, let's make it (+2,+1) - Emma's trick is impressive, but Olivia's singing also gets some appreciation\n\n2. Second scenario (Magic Trick vs Draw):\nInstead of +1/-1, let's make it (-1,+3) - Olivia's artwork really steals the show, while Emma feels a bit overshadowed\n\n3. Third scenario (Joke vs Sing):\nInstead of -1/+1, let's make it (+1,+2) - Both performances go well, with Olivia's song getting slightly more attention\n\n4. Fourth scenario (Joke vs Draw):\nInstead of +3/-3, let's make it (+3,+1) - Emma's joke is a huge hit, but Olivia's drawing still gets some compliments\n\nThis new version shows that positive attention for one sister doesn't necessarily mean negative attention for the other, which is more realistic in a healthy family dynamic.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (2,1), (-1,3) ],\n [ (1,2), (3,1) ]]",
