In a zero-sum game, the gains of one player must equal the losses of the other player, meaning their sum should always be zero.\n\nLet's analyze each scenario and adjust the payoffs:\n\n1. Professor lectures and student studies:\nOriginal: Professor +2, Student -2\nThis already sums to 0, so we can keep it.\n\n2. Professor lectures and student listens:\nOriginal: Professor +2, Student -2\nThis also already sums to 0, so we can keep it.\n\n3. Professor advises and student studies:\nOriginal: Professor +4, Student -4\nThis also sums to 0, so we can keep it.\n\n4. Professor advises and student listens:\nOriginal: Professor -1, Student -1\nThis needs to be changed because it doesn't sum to 0.\nLet's make it: Professor +1, Student -1\n\nAll payoffs are now adjusted to ensure that for each outcome, the sum of both players' payoffs equals zero, making it a proper zero-sum game.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (2,-2), (2,-2) ],\n [ (4,-4), (1,-1) ]]",
