In a zero-sum game, one player's gain must be exactly equal to the other player's loss, and the sum of payoffs in each outcome must equal zero.\n\nLooking at the original payoffs:\n(+1,+1), (-1,-1), (-1,-1), (+1,+1)\n\nTo convert this into a zero-sum game, we need to make sure that for each outcome, the payoffs sum to 0. Let's modify the scenario while keeping the same basic structure:\n\nFor Mom's and Emily's competition, now we'll make it so that any satisfaction one gets comes at the expense of the other:\n\nIf Mom suggests park and Emily pushes for movie, Mom gets her way more (wins +2), Emily loses out (-2)\n\nIf Mom suggests park and Emily pushes for cookies, Emily gets more of her preference (wins +1), Mom loses out (-1)\n\nIf Mom suggests staying home and Emily pushes for movie, Emily gets more of her preference (wins +3), Mom loses out (-3)\n\nIf Mom suggests staying home and Emily pushes for cookies, Mom gets her way more (wins +2), Emily loses out (-2)\n\nThis creates a proper zero-sum game where each outcome's payoffs sum to zero.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (2,-2), (-1,1) ],\n [ (-3,3), (2,-2) ]]",
