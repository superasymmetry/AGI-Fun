Here's an example:\n\nA sonnet is a poem with a verse\nIts form is simple, neat, and heavenly\nThe Shakespeare game it plays, for well or worse\nThe hair aglow the magic of the tree\n\nA sonnet's structure is strict and clear,\nBut in this case, I'll break the rule, you see:\nA sonnet's final couplet should appear\nAt the end, not tucked away in the middle.\nA calculator lives above my brain,\nI find the paint and island, not a hall,\nBut I digress, for I know only rain,\nThe rabid days of Michael are behind.\nAnd to Montana, purpose he will seek,\nThe German man eats flesh and not the rind,\nOf juicy oranges of which I speak,\nAnd now the final butterfly draws near.\nBut here's the twist, I'll add a hidden line:\nThis sonnet's structure's not quite as divine.\nA hidde couplet sheds a single tear.\n\nThis text maintains the sonnet's structure but breaks the rule about the final couplet, making it an instance of a non-Shakespearean sonnet."
