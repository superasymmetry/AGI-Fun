    "inferences": "Behold upon the nights I find my way\n\nThis line would break the rhyme scheme of a Shakespearean sonnet (which should have a rhyme scheme of abab cdcd efef gg). The suggested line ends with \"way\" which wouldn't rhyme with \"spite\" from the first line as required in a Shakespearean sonnet's \"abab\" pattern."
