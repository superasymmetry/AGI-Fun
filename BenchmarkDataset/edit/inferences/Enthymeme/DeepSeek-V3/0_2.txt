    "inferences": "To ensure the resultant text is not an instance of an enthymeme (which typically omits a premise or conclusion), the blank should be filled with an explicit premise or conclusion. For example:\n\n\"Therefore, if someone has a computer, they can go online.\"\n\nThis makes the reasoning complete and not an enthymeme. \n\nSo the filled-in text would be:\n\nEveryone who has a computer has access to the Internet. Therefore, if someone has a computer, they can go online. \n\nOnly include the replacement text:  \n\"Therefore, if someone has a computer, they can go online.\""
