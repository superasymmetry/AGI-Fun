    "example": "My husband (M27) and I (F28) have been married for almost 4 years now, been together for 6 years. Do I have a roommate or husband? As more and more days go by I feel like I have a roommate more that a husband. I am and have been the sole income for our relationship and I come home and have to be the one who has to cleans, cooks, and take care of the animals. All while he is sleeping all day and chooses to play video games all night. I have asked for more help with the responsibilities of the house and he says he will but it only last for a week before we are in the same routine all over again. He did manage to get a job after 5 years into the relationship but all the responsibilities at home have still falling into my lap. I am still the only one paying our bills and don't ever have money for myself while anything he makes is used how he pleases. And on top of all that we are not intimate and any way anymore. It has gotten to the point if I try to initiate something in the bedroom and shrugs me off. I won't lie and say that doesn't hurt and has caused me to feel like I am the problem or no longer attractive in his eyes. But it has been almost 3 years now and I don't even think I would want to anymore even if he tried. I have gone back and forth about if I should stay in the marriage but have been to scared of the unknown of leaving to take the leap.\n\n",
