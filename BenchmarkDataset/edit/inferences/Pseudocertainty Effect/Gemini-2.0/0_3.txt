    "example": "I know the title sounds silly but I'm talking about a dude in his 20s who is dropping his legitimate diploma to pursue singing full time as employment.\n\nI (20sF) met him in middle school and we've been very close friends on and off ever since. I know he was born into a family who is very \"artistically inclined\", as in, everyone in his family is an artist, so he's always been passionate about singing. He was a nerdy studious kid who got the best grades and for most of the time, singing was just his side interest.\n\nHe used to get bullied for singing in school because, to be honest, he's a terrible singer. His voice is weak and shaky, he writes lyrics that are either very cliche or nonsensical, but I and all of his friends would clap and support him, first because we didn't want him to feel bad and secondly because we thought he could improve, but damn, talent shows were genuinely painful for us.\n\nFast forward to now, this guy has a good job in a well-paying respected field outside of the arts and is almost graduating from a prestigious school. However, he recently told us that even though he loves his job and his field, he noticed that he barely has time to sing and write songs now, and he is finally ready to make the big step and choose singing as his full-time activity. He had already quit his job by the time he told us that because he didn't want anyone \"talking him out of it\", but he will wait until the end of this semester to drop out of school.\n\nFor all of these years, he's been releasing original songs and he genuinely thinks / is convinced that they only get 50 to 100 views because he isn't releasing enough of them and putting in that extra time. He does everything to go viral on social media and never works out, but he always finds a couple of well-meaning but unhelpful strangers to comment \"it'll work brother, you just gotta practice more and work harder, fck what other people think\".\n\nTalking to other friends about it, they're all shocked and worried about this decision, but since his family always supports him no matter what, they think that we won't be able to change his mind. Telling him the truth will just drive him away, my friends think that it's best to let him try and make the mistake by himself.\n\nI think I should've said something way sooner and now I might be just an asshole if I tell him that, honestly, he's terrible at singing and songwriting.\n\nWIBTA?",
