    "label": "yes",
    "inferences": "To avoid creating an instance of asyndeton (the deliberate omission of conjunctions between parts of a sentence), you should include a conjunction in the blank. Here\u2019s the text with the blank filled appropriately:\n\n\"I laughed, *and* moved me,\"  \n\nThe word \"and\" is the conjunction that prevents the sentence from being an example of asyndeton. \n\nHowever, the sentence \"I laughed, and moved me,\" is grammatically incorrect because \"moved me\" lacks a subject. A corrected version would be:  \n\n\"I laughed, *and it* moved me.\"  \n\nBut if you strictly want only the text to replace the blank (assuming the rest of the sentence is correct), then just \"and\" would suffice to avoid asyndeton, even though the sentence remains awkward.  \n\nSo the answer is:  \n**and**  \n\n(But note that the full corrected sentence would require \"and it\" or another subject.)"
