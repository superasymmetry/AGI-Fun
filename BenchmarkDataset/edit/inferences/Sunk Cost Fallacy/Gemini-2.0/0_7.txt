    "example": "I am 19 female and I have a boyfriend who comes every saturday night to have dinner with my family and me. My family were downstairs talking and waiting for me, I showered and went downstairs. My shoes were a bit wet but no big deal according to me. My dad saw that a few drops fell in the floor (literally a few drops) and said that I am so disgusting and I have to clean the floor now. I quietly took a mop and cleaned the floor while my dad was talking to my boyfriend about how bad I am and disgustingly dirty person that he will realize this once we marry. I would normally respond to a comment like that but I was numb, I took my things and put the mop in its place and went uo to my room and locked myself to cry. My boyfriend made up an excuse and left. Was I an asshole? Childish? Should I have stayed?\n\n",
