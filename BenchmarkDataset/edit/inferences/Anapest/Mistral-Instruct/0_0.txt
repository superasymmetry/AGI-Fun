Anapest is a metrical foot consisting of two short syllables followed by one long syllable, such as da-DUM. The options provided are metrical feet with a different syllable pattern:\n\n- Trochaic: one long syllable followed by one short syllable, such as DUM-da\n- Iambic: one short syllable followed by one long syllable, such as da-DUM\n- Dactylic: one long syllable followed by two short syllables, such as DUM-da-da\n\nTherefore, any of these options (Trochaic, Iambic, or Dactylic) could replace the blank \"Further_\" to avoid creating an Anapest."
