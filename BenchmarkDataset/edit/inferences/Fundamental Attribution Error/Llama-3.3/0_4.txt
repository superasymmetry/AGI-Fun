I managed to snag one of the last decent shopping carts and was halfway through my list produce, some household stuff, a few snacks when this lady barrels around the corner and literally blocks my path.\n\nShe\u2019s probably in her 50s, dressed like she\u2019s heading to a country club.\n\nMe: \u201cUm\u2026 no, it\u2019s mine. I\u2019ve been using it for like twenty minutes.\u201d\n\nShe scowls and gestures at the cart.\n\nRude Lady: \u201cThat\u2019s the cart I left by the entrance while I went to get my coupons. It\u2019s mine.\u201d\n\nNow, I\u2019m staring at the cart my cart which has my purse, my reusable bags, and a bunch of groceries. Also, she said she left it by the entrance. I\u2019m in the middle of the store, nowhere near the front.\n\nMe: \u201cThis definitely isn\u2019t your cart. I grabbed it when I walked in, and it already had someone else\u2019s empty coffee cup in it.\u201d\n\nRude Lady: \u201cWell, it\u2019s my cart now. You can take another one.\u201d\n\nAt this point, a Walmart employee comes over, probably because she\u2019s attracting attention with her Karen-level tone.\n\nEmployee: \u201cIs there a problem here?\u201d\n\nRude Lady: \u201cYes! She took my cart and is refusing to give it back!\u201d\n\nThe employee looks at the cart. Then at me. Then back at her. He clearly knows what\u2019s up.\n\nEmployee: \u201cMa\u2019am, if she\u2019s been using the cart and her items are in it, it\u2019s not your cart. We can get you another one.\u201d\n\nRude Lady: \u201cI don\u2019t want another one. I want that one! I already touched it, and it has better wheels.\u201d\n\nBetter wheels. I kid you not. She was arguing over the wheels.\n\nEventually, after some more dramatic sighing and muttering about \u201cthe decline of respect in younger generations,\u201d and \u201cthe young should respect the old\u201d, she stomped off\u2026 and I saw her grab another cart, immediately start complaining about its squeaky wheel, and leave it behind in the cereal aisle.\n\nPeople are wild.",
