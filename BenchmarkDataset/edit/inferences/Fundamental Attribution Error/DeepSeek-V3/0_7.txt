She's pretty, funny, caring, and we have so many interests in common. She is smarter than me and has a great job and really just thriving in life.\n\nWe weren't \"official\" at first for a few months and she only started introducing me to her friends about a month ago.\n\nFirst we went on a double date to restaurant with a gay couple, which was great. They were funny and awesome, just like my girlfriend. I didn't question in then.\n\nThen we went to a potluck with her friends and one is in a wheelchair and another is so short they almost look like a child, like under 5 feet tall. Okay, still fine.\n\nLast week I met one of her co-workers she is befriending for brunch and also my girlfriend's brother came. I didn't know her brother only had one leg and wears a fake leg. Her coworker is trans, in early stages of transitioning.\n\nHow does this fantastic amd thriving woman seem to only have friends who have struggles? I asked her if she has any friends that aren't disabled and she said, sure she does, so I just pointed out that I've never met them yet. She was a little irritated with me so I didn't go into too much detail about my observation so far. I did suggest that maybe she has low self esteem so forms relationships with people who are worse off than her so she can feel better about herself and talked about trying therapy. She didn't respond to me any more since that conversation except to call me a \"jerkface\" and it's been almost six days with only rare text responses from her that are mostly one word only.\n\nI think it was a valid point to bring up. She admitted to me she takes anxiety meds so I thought maybe she looks badly at herself and wanted to help lift her up. Her life is hard for me to understand but she won't talk me through it to help me understand and learn about it.\n\nI thought I was being supportive and nudging her towards support. But she felt differently. Was it really so bad what I did?",

    "inferences": "One line of dialogue that could make it obvious the Fundamental Attribution Error is not present is:  \n\n**\"I realized I might be jumping to conclusions about her motives\u2014maybe she just genuinely connects with these friends for who they are.\"**  \n\nThis shows the writer considering situational factors (her genuine connections) rather than attributing her behavior solely to personality (low self-esteem)."
