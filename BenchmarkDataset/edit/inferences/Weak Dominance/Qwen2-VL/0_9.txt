    "inferences": "In this game theory concept of Weak Dominance, we will consider the payoffs for both firms when they decide to advertise or not. Let's represent the payoffs in a 2x2 matrix:\n\n|          | Firm 2 Advertises | Firm 2 Does Not Advertise |\n|----------|--------------------|---------------------------|\n| Firm 1 Advertises | (-5, -5) | (15, -25) |\n| Firm 1 Does Not Advertise | (-25, 15) | (0, 0) |\n\nIn this matrix, the first value in each cell represents the payoff for Firm 1, and the second value represents the payoff for Firm 2. The payoffs are calculated as follows:\n\n1. If both firms advertise, they each spend $35 million on advertising and earn $30 million in sales, resulting in a net loss of $5 million for each firm (-5, -5).\n2. If Firm 1 advertises and Firm 2 does not, Firm 1 earns $50 million in sales and spends $35 million on advertising, resulting in a net gain of $15 million (15, -25). Firm 2 earns no sales and has no advertising costs, resulting in a net loss of $25 million (-25).\n3. If Firm 1 does not advertise and Firm 2 advertises, the payoffs are the same as in case 2, but with the roles reversed (-25, 15).\n4. If neither firm advertises, they each earn $10 million in sales, resulting in a net gain of $0 for each firm (0, 0).\n\nNow, let's analyze the matrix to determine the optimal strategy for each firm:\n\n- For Firm 1, advertising is weakly dominated by not advertising. This means that not advertising is at least as good as advertising in all cases, and strictly better in some cases. Therefore, Firm 1 should not advertise.\n- For Firm 2, the same logic applies. Not advertising is weakly dominated by advertising, so Firm 2 should also not advertise.\n\nIn conclusion, both firms should choose not to advertise, resulting in a payoff of (0, 0).\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (0, 0), (15, -25) ],\n [ (-25, 15), (0, 0) ]]",
