    "inferences": "To make the example not an instance of Weak Dominance, we need to ensure that there is no strategy that is weakly dominated by another strategy for either player. In the original example, the strategy of advertising is weakly dominated by the strategy of not advertising for both firms, since not advertising always results in a higher payoff regardless of the opponent's strategy.\nTo remove this weak dominance, we can change the payoffs for the (Advertise, Advertise) outcome to be higher than the payoffs for the (Not Advertise, Not Advertise) outcome. This will make the strategy of advertising the dominant strategy for both firms, since it will always result in a higher payoff regardless of the opponent's strategy.\nHere is an updated payoff matrix that meets the provided conditions and removes the weak dominance:\n[[ (20,20), (50,0) ],\n [ (0,50), (30,30) ]]\nIn this matrix, if both firms advertise, they both get $20 million in sales. If one firm advertises but the other firm does not, then the company that advertises gets $50 million in sales, and the other company gets no sales. If both firms don't advertise, then both firms get $30 million dollars in sales. For both firms, cereal costs no money to produce, and advertising costs $30 million.\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (20,20), (50,0) ],\n [ (0,50), (30,30) ]]",
