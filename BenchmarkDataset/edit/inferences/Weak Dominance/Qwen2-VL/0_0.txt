    "inferences": "To make the example not an instance of Weak Dominance, we need to ensure that there is no strategy that is always worse than another strategy for any player. In the original example, going to the Harvard Square cafe is weakly dominant because it always results in a 5-minute wait, while the wait at the Central Square cafe can vary between 5 and 10 minutes. To remove this weak dominance, we can introduce a scenario where the wait at the Central Square cafe is always shorter than the wait at the Harvard Square cafe. For example, we can assume that the wait at the Central Square cafe is always 4 minutes, while the wait at the Harvard Square cafe is always 5 minutes. In this case, going to the Central Square cafe is now strictly dominant, as it always results in a shorter wait time. Therefore, the example is no longer an instance of Weak Dominance. <OUTPUT>[[ (5,5), (5,4) ],\n [ (4,5), (4,4) ]]",
