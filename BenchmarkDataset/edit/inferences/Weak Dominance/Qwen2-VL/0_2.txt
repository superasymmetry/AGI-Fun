    "inferences": "In the original example, the concept of Weak Dominance is present because one of the player's strategies (going to building 52) is weakly dominated by the other strategy (going to building 45). This is because the player is indifferent between being alone in building 52 and being with their brother in building 45, but prefers to be with their brother in building 45 if they are going to see their brother at all.\n\nTo change the example to make it not an instance of Weak Dominance, we need to modify the player's preferences so that they strictly prefer one strategy over the other. For example, we could say that the player prefers to be with their brother in building 45 over being alone in building 52, but still prefers building 52 over building 45 if they are going to be alone. This would eliminate the weak dominance because the player now has a strict preference for one strategy over the other.\n\nHere is a modified example:\n\nI'm trying to meet up with my brother in Cambridge, but his phone just died and I cannot reach him. We always meet up in either building 45 or building 52 at MIT, and I know he'll go to one of those buildings right now.

I like building 52 more than building 45, but I prefer to be with my brother in building 45 over being alone in building 52. Which building should I go to?\n\nIn this modified example, the player strictly prefers to be with their brother in building 45 over being alone in building 52, so the concept of Weak Dominance is no longer present.",
