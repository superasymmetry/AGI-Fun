Building 45 is one strategy, and Building 52 is the other. Since you don't care which building you end up at, your payoffs will be the same regardless of the building. However, your brother's payoff will depend on whether you both meet at the same building or not.\n\nLet's assume the payoffs for meeting at the same building are higher than not meeting. We can assign a higher value, say 1, for meeting and a lower value, say 0, for not meeting. Since you don't care which building you end up at, your payoffs will be the same for both buildings. Let's assign a value of 1 for both buildings for you.\n\nThe payoff matrix for this game would be:\n\n[[ (1,1), (1,0) ],\n [ (1,0), (1,1) ]]\n\nIn this matrix, the first number in each cell represents your payoff, and the second number represents your brother's payoff. The rows represent your choices (Building 45 or Building 52), and the columns represent your brother's choices (Building 45 or Building 52).\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (1,1), (1,0) ],\n [ (1,0), (1,1) ]]",
