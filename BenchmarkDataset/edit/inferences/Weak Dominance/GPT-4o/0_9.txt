    "inferences": "To create a game theory scenario that involves weak dominance, we need a strategy that provides a higher or equal payoff compared to another strategy in all situations, and a strictly higher payoff in at least one situation.\n\nLet's modify the payoffs in the original scenario to illustrate weak dominance. Assume:\n\n- Both firms advertise: Both get $5 million each in sales after costs.\n- Your firm advertises and the competitor does not: Your firm gets $15 million, competitor loses $5 million.\n- Competitor advertises and your firm does not: Competitor gets $15 million, your firm loses $5 million.\n- Neither firm advertises: Both get $10 million each.\n\nGiven this environment, if advertising still provides a lower payoff or is equal to not advertising across some situations (and is strictly better in others), but not strictly greater across all, then it represents weak dominance.  \n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (5,5), (15,-5) ],\n [ (-5,15), (10,10) ]]\n<OUTPUT>",
