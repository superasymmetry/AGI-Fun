    "inferences": "To make the modified rock-paper-scissors game not exhibit weak dominance, we need to ensure that no strategy strictly benefits a player across all responses of the opponent. Originally, the scenario might allow a weakly dominating strategy depending on the payoffs. To change this, let's adjust the payoff structure such that neither player's strategy strictly dominates the others. \n\nLet's consider the payoff for various strategies:\n\n1. Scissors vs. any strategy (Scissors, Rock, Paper): \n   - If either player chooses Scissors, both get 0 points.\n   \n2. Rock vs. Paper:\n   - Rock loses to Paper, scoring 3 and 2 for Rock and Paper respectively.\n\n3. Rock vs. Rock:\n   - Both get 4 points.\n\n4. Paper vs. Paper:\n   - Both get 1 point.\n\nTo break weak dominance, change the rock vs paper outcome. For example, make the rock vs paper payoff equal and symmetrical, so picking either strategy does not yield a strictly better reward when facing an opponent. We can make them both earn 2 points. Let's represent this in the payoff matrix format:\n\nPlayer 1's strategies are the rows, and Player 2's strategies are the columns.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n\n[[ (0,0), (3,2), (0,0) ],\n [ (2,3), (4,4), (2,2) ],\n [ (0,0), (2,2), (1,1) ]]",
