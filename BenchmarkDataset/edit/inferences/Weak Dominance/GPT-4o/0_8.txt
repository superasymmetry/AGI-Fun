In the original example, advertising weakly dominates not advertising because advertising always yields an equal or better payoff, regardless of what the competitor does.\n\nLet's adjust the payoffs to remove this dominance:\n\n- If both firms advertise, each earns $20 million in sales.\n- If one firm advertises and the other does not, the advertising firm earns $55 million, but the non-advertising firm earns $5 million.\n- If neither firm advertises, each earns $15 million in sales.\n\nNow let's represent this situation with a payoff matrix with Player 1 as my firm and Player 2 as the competitor firm:\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (20,20), (55,5) ],\n [ (5,55), (15,15) ]]\n<OUTPUT>",
