    "inferences": "To illustrate the concept of weak dominance in a game theory setting, we need to establish payoffs for each of the choices based on waiting times, and introduce a player whose actions affect these waits.\n\nLet's define the players and their strategies:\n\n- Player 1 (You) has two strategies: Go to Harvard Square (H) or go to Central Square (C).\n- Player 2 (Others) has two strategies: More people go to Harvard Square (M) or more people go to Central Square (N).\n\nFor simplicity, let's assume the payoff is inversely related to the wait time; the shorter the wait, the higher the payoff.\n\nIn the original scenario, the Harvard Square cafe always has a 5-minute wait. The Central Square cafe has a wait time that varies depending on Player 2's choice. Assume specific wait times for clarity:\n\n- If Player 2 chooses M, the wait at Central Square is 10 minutes.\n- If Player 2 chooses N, the wait at Central Square is 3 minutes.\n\nNow, let's define the payoffs:\n\n- In Harvard (H), the wait is fixed at 5 minutes (Payoff: 10 - 5 = 5).\n- In Central with choice M (CM), the wait is 10 minutes (Payoff: 10 - 10 = 0).\n- In Central with choice N (CN), the wait is 3 minutes (Payoff: 10 - 3 = 7).\n\nFor Player 2, let's assume the payoff is based on the distribution of people which affects their wait quality too.\n\nHere is the payoff matrix reflecting the weak dominance:\n\n<OUTPUT>\n\n[[ (5,5), (5,5) ],\n [ (0,7), (7,0) ]]",
