    "inferences": "To eliminate weak dominance and make the decision scenario more complex, consider introducing more variability and add distinct factors other than the wait time. For instance:\n\n- The Harvard Square cafe often has a 5-minute wait; however, its food quality slightly drops during weekends due to high customer volume. Additionally, the seating is less comfortable than in Central Square.\n- The Central Square cafe has a fluctuating wait time, ranging from 5 to 15 minutes. However, during weekdays, the service is quicker, and they offer a 10% discount on orders.\n\nBy introducing these factors, weak dominance is eliminated and choices become more strategic. Each option has unique strengths depending on the day and customer preferences, creating space for varied decision outcomes.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n\n[[ (5,7), (6,8) ],\n [ (7,5), (8,6) ]]\n\n",
