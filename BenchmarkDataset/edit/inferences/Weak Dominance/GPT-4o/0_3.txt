    "inferences": "To illustrate weak dominance, we need to introduce a situation where one strategy is weakly dominant over another for one of the players.\n\nLet's transform the original example into a game involving two players: you and your brother. You each independently choose one of the two buildings (Building 45 or Building 52) to meet at.\n\nThe payoffs are such that you both receive some benefit if you meet at the same building. However, there may be slight differences in payoffs that introduce weak dominance.\n\nConsider the following payoffs:\n- If you both choose Building 45, you receive a payoff of (2, 2).\n- If you choose Building 45 and your brother chooses Building 52, you receive a payoff of (1, 0).\n- If you choose Building 52 and your brother chooses Building 45, you receive a payoff of (0, 1).\n- If you both choose Building 52, you receive a payoff of (3, 3).\n\nIn this scenario, choosing Building 52 is weakly dominant for both players because:\n- The payoff from both choosing Building 52 (3, 3) is higher than both choosing Building 45 (2, 2).\n- If there is a mismatch (one chooses 45 and the other 52), the building 52 chooser always gets at least 3 or equals the payoff received if both chose 45.\n\nIn this modified game, choosing Building 52 weakly dominates choosing Building 45 because it sometimes yields a higher payoff and never a lower payoff than choosing the alternative. Now, let's create the payoff matrix.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (2,2), (1,0) ],\n [ (0,1), (3,3) ]]",
