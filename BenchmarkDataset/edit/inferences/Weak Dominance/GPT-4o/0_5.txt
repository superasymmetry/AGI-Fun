    "inferences": "To introduce the concept of weak dominance in this modified rock-paper-scissors game, we can adjust the game's payoff structure. In game theory, a strategy weakly dominates another if it is better in some scenarios and not worse in all scenarios compared to the other strategy. Here's how you can change the payoffs:\n\n1. If at least one of us plays scissors, then we both still get 0 points.\n2. If one person plays rock and the other plays paper, keep the payoffs the same: the person playing rock wins 3 points, and the person playing paper wins 2 points.\n3. If both players play rock, both win 1 point.\n4. If both players play paper, change the payoffs to make playing paper weakly dominate playing rock. Assign both players 1 point if they both play paper and 0 points when one plays rock against another's paper (specifically reverse the earlier payoff for rock-paper).\n\nLet's represent this game with a payoff matrix:\n\nStrategies: \n- R: Rock\n- P: Paper\n- S: Scissors\n\n<OUTPUT>\n\n[[ (1,1), (3,2), (0,0) ],\n [ (0,0), (1,1), (0,0) ]]",
