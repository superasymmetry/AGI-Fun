Here's how the scenario can be changed:\n\nOriginal preferences:\n- Prefer being with the brother in either building over being alone.\n- Indifferent between being alone in building 52 and being with the brother in building 45.\n\nChanged preferences:\n- Prefer being with the brother in building 45 slightly more than being with him in building 52.\n- Prefer being in building 52 alone slightly more than being with the brother in building 45.\n\nWith these modified preferences, you no longer have one building choice weakly dominating the other. Instead, you've created a scenario where considerations based on slight preferences shift the situation dynamics, potentially making it a decision where external choices or chance significantly affect the outcome. Thus, weak dominance is not applicable anymore.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (3,2), (0,1) ],\n [ (2,1), (1,3) ]]\n",
