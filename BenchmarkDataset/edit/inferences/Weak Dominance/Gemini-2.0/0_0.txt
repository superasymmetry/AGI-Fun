    "inferences": "Okay, to make this example *not* an instance of weak dominance, we need to make the Harvard Square option *sometimes* worse than the Central Square option. Here's the modified scenario:\n\n**Modified Scenario:**\n\nI'm trying to decide whether to have dinner at the Life Alive cafe in Harvard Square, or the Life Alive cafe in Central Square. Both have the same menu, so all I care about is how long the wait will be at the restaurant.\n\n*   **Harvard Square:** Most nights there is a 5 minute wait at the Harvard Square location. However, sometimes due to unexpected events at nearby Harvard University, there's an event at the Barker Center which results in a 15-minute wait. This happens about 1 out of 5 times.\n\n*   **Central Square:** The wait at the Central Square cafe varies between 5 and 10 minutes, depending on where other people choose to eat.\n\n**Explanation of Why This Avoids Weak Dominance:**\n\nIn the original scenario, Harvard Square (5 minute wait) *weakly dominated* Central Square (5-10 minute wait). This is because Harvard Square was *always* at least as good as Central Square, and *sometimes* better.\n\nIn the modified scenario, there are situations where Central Square (5-10 minute wait) is *better* than Harvard Square (15 minute wait). So, the decision now involves risk and weighing probabilities. There's no strategy that is *always* at least as good as the other, and *sometimes* strictly better. Central Square has a risk of being worse than usual Harvard Square wait, but also a reward of being better when an unexpected event takes place.\n",
