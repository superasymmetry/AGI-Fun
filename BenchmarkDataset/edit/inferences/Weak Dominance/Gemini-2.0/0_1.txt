    "inferences": "Here's a revised scenario that demonstrates **Weak Dominance**:\n\n**Scenario:**\n\nI'm trying to decide whether to have dinner at the Life Alive cafe in Harvard Square, or the Life Alive cafe in Central Square. Both have the same menu, so all I care about is how long the wait will be at the restaurant.\n\n*   **Harvard Square:** I know from experience that there's usually a 5 minute wait in the Harvard Square cafe. However, sometimes (rarely) there is a 10-minute wait due to a large event.\n*   **Central Square:** The wait in the Central Square cafe varies. Most of the time it's between 3 and 5 minutes, depending on where other people choose to eat. However, sometimes (rarely) there is a 5-minute wait.\n\n**Explanation of Weak Dominance:**\n\nIn this scenario, going to the Central Square location is a *weakly dominant* strategy. Here's why:\n\n*   **Central Square is *at least as good as* Harvard Square in all scenarios:** In most cases, Central Square is better (3-5 minute wait vs. 5-10 minute wait).\n*   **Central Square is *strictly better than* Harvard Square in *at least one* scenario:** There are plenty of cases where Central Square has a shorter wait than Harvard Square.\n*   **There is *at least one* scenario where the outcomes of each location are equal:** Sometimes Central Square has a 5-minute wait, just like Harvard Square.\n\nTherefore, going to Central Square is *always* at least as good as going to Harvard Square, and *sometimes* better. This is the definition of weak dominance. You would always choose Central Square, or be indifferent between the two, but never choose Harvard Square.",
