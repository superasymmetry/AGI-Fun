    "inferences": "To remove weak dominance from the scenario, we need to alter the payoffs so that neither advertising nor not advertising *weakly dominates* the other.  A strategy weakly dominates another if it always yields a payoff at least as good, and sometimes strictly better.\n\nHere's a modified scenario:\n\n**My firm and a competitor firm are deciding whether or not we want to advertise for the cereal we\u2019re selling.**\n\n*   **If both firms advertise:** We both get $30 million in sales.\n*   **If I advertise, and the competitor *doesn't*:**  I get $50 million in sales.\n*   **If I *don't* advertise, and the competitor *does*:** I get $10 million in sales.\n*   **If neither firm advertises:** We both get $40 million in sales.\n\n**For both firms, cereal costs no money to produce, and advertising costs $30 million.**\n\n**Payoff Matrix (My Firm)**\n\n|             | Competitor Advertises | Competitor Doesn't Advertise |\n|-------------|-----------------------|------------------------------|\n| Advertise   | $30M - $30M = $0M     | $50M - $30M = $20M           |\n| Don't Advertise | $10M                 | $40M                           |\n\n**Analysis**\n\n*   **If the competitor advertises:**\n    *   Advertising yields $0M.\n    *   Not advertising yields $10M.\n    *   **Therefore, if the competitor advertises, I should NOT advertise.**\n*   **If the competitor doesn't advertise:**\n    *   Advertising yields $20M.\n    *   Not advertising yields $40M.\n    *   **Therefore, if the competitor doesn't advertise, I should NOT advertise.**\n\nIn this modified scenario:\n\n*   **Not Advertising dominates Advertising**\n*   The competitor will reason the same way, meaning the Nash Equilibrium is for both to not advertise and make $40M.\n\n**Why This Modification Works**\n\nThe key change is increasing the payoff for *both* firms when *neither* advertises.  This makes not advertising a good option when the other firm also doesn't advertise. If the competitor advertises the payoff is higher if you do not advertise than if you do, making it a dominant strategy to not advertise.\n",
