    "inferences": "Here's the adjustment to make the scenario an example of **Weak Dominance**, along with the explanation:\n\n**Modified Scenario:**\n\nMy firm and a competitor firm are deciding whether or not we want to advertise for the cereal we\u2019re selling.\n\n*   **If both firms advertise:** We both get $30 million in sales. Advertising costs $35 million. (Profit: -$5 million)\n*   **If my firm advertises, and the competitor does not:** I get $50 million in sales. Advertising costs $35 million. The competitor gets no sales. (Profit: $15 million for me, $0 million for them)\n*   **If my firm does not advertise, and the competitor does:** I get no sales. The competitor gets $50 million in sales. Advertising costs $35 million. (Profit: $0 million for me, $15 million for them)\n*   **If neither firm advertises:** We both get $10 million in sales. Advertising costs $35 million. (Profit: $10 million)\n\n**Should my firm advertise or not?**\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nNow let's analyze the payoff matrix:\n\n|                     | Competitor Advertises | Competitor Doesn't Advertise |\n|---------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------|\n| **I Advertise**     | -$5 Million             | $15 Million                  |\n| **I Don't Advertise** | $0 Million             | $10 Million                  |\n\n*   **Consider the scenario where the competitor *does* advertise:** If I advertise, I lose $5 million. If I don't advertise, I get $0 million. In this case, *not advertising* is better than advertising.\n*   **Consider the scenario where the competitor *doesn't* advertise:** If I advertise, I get $15 million. If I don't advertise, I get $10 million. In this case, *advertising* is better than not advertising.\n\nThus, neither action is strictly dominant, but not advertising weakly dominates advertising.\n\n**Explanation of Weak Dominance:**\n\nA strategy is *weakly dominant* if it is at least as good as any other strategy, regardless of what the other players do, *and* there is at least one scenario where it is strictly better.\n\nIn this adjusted example:\n\n*   *Not advertising* is **never worse** than *advertising* for my firm.\n*   When the competitor *does* advertise, *not advertising* is **better** than advertising.\n\nTherefore, *not advertising* is a weakly dominant strategy for my firm.\n",
