    "inferences": "Okay, let's modify the payoff matrix so that neither strategy weakly dominates the other for me. A strategy weakly dominates another if it always provides a payoff that is *at least as good* as the other strategy, and *sometimes strictly better*. To eliminate weak dominance, we need to ensure that for each strategy, there is at least one scenario where the *other* strategy is *strictly* better.\n\nHere's the modified payoff matrix:\n\nActions (A, A) leads to payoffs (4, 7)\nActions (A, B) leads to payoffs (0, 3)\nActions (B, A) leads to payoffs (2, 2)\nActions (B, B) leads to payoffs (1, 1)\n\n**Explanation of why this eliminates weak dominance:**\n\n*   **Strategy A:** If the computer plays A, I get 4. If the computer plays B, I get 0.\n*   **Strategy B:** If the computer plays A, I get 2. If the computer plays B, I get 1.\n\nNow, let's analyze for weak dominance:\n\n*   Does A weakly dominate B?\n\n    *   If the computer plays A: A gives 4, B gives 2. A is better.\n    *   If the computer plays B: A gives 0, B gives 1. B is better.\n\n    Since there exists one case where B is better than A (when the computer plays B), A does not weakly dominate B.\n\n*   Does B weakly dominate A?\n\n    *   If the computer plays A: B gives 2, A gives 4. A is better.\n    *   If the computer plays B: B gives 1, A gives 0. B is better.\n\n    Since there exists one case where A is better than B (when the computer plays A), B does not weakly dominate A.\n\nTherefore, in this modified scenario, neither strategy (A or B) weakly dominates the other for me.\n",
