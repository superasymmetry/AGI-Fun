A strategy is weakly dominant if it yields at least as good a payoff as any other strategy *regardless* of what the other player does, and strictly better in at least one case.\n\nHere's the modified payoff matrix:\n\nActions (A, A) leads to payoffs (4, 7)\nActions (A, B) leads to payoffs (2, 3)\nActions (B, A) leads to payoffs (4, 2)\nActions (B, B) leads to payoffs (1, 1)\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n*   **If the Computer plays A:**  My payoff for playing A is 4, and my payoff for playing B is 4.  A is *at least as good* as B.\n*   **If the Computer plays B:** My payoff for playing A is 2, and my payoff for playing B is 1. A is *strictly better* than B.\n\nSince playing A is always *at least* as good as playing B, and is *sometimes* better, action A is now weakly dominant.\n",
