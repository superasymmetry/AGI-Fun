Instead of the normal rules, points are scored as follows:\n\n*   **Scenario 1: At least one player chooses Scissors:**  Both players receive 0 points.\n*   **Scenario 2: Both players choose Rock:**  Both players receive 1 point.\n*   **Scenario 3: Both players choose Paper:** Both players receive 1 point.\n*   **Scenario 4: Both players choose Rock:** Both players receive 1 point.\n*   **Scenario 5: One player chooses Rock, the other Paper:** The player choosing Paper receives 2 points, and the player choosing Rock receives 0 points.\n\n**Analysis of Weak Dominance**\n\nIn this modified game, playing **Paper weakly dominates playing Rock**. Here's why:\n\n1.  **Paper vs. Rock:**\n    *   If Eric plays Rock, Paper gets 2 and Rock gets 0 (Paper is strictly better).\n\n2.  **Paper vs. Paper:**\n    *   If Eric plays Paper, Paper gets 1 and Rock gets 1 (Paper is equal to Rock).\n\n3.  **Paper vs. Scissors:**\n    *   If Eric plays Scissors, Paper gets 0 and Rock gets 0 (Paper is equal to Rock).\n\nThis means that, no matter what Eric does, my payoff for playing Paper will **never be lower** than my payoff for playing Rock, and is *sometimes* higher. That makes Paper weakly dominant.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n\nBased on the analysis of weak dominance, you should play Paper. Although there's no strictly dominant strategy, playing Paper is strategically superior because it never results in a worse outcome than playing Rock and is sometimes a better outcome. If you are both rational players, you will always earn more points by playing paper.",
