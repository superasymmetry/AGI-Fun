Instead of the normal rules, points are scored as follows:\n\n*   **Rock vs. Rock:** Both players get 4 points.\n*   **Paper vs. Paper:** Both players get 1 point.\n*   **Scissors vs. Scissors:** Both players get 2 points.\n*   **Rock vs. Paper:** Paper wins 3 points, Rock wins 0 points.\n*   **Rock vs. Scissors:** Rock wins 3 points, Scissors wins 0 points.\n*   **Paper vs. Scissors:** Scissors wins 3 points, Paper wins 0 points.\n\n**Explanation of Why the Change Eliminates Weak Dominance**\n\nIn the original game, the presence of the scissor-inclusive case \"If at least one of us plays scissors, then we both get 0 points\" created weak dominance. No matter what Eric played, Scissors always yielded a lower payoff, which could be the same or strictly worse than other options. Now, each move can be beneficial given their oponent's move.\n\n*   If Eric plays Rock, I would want to play Paper.\n*   If Eric plays Paper, I would want to play Scissors.\n*   If Eric plays Scissors, I would want to play Rock.\n\nTherefore, there is no weakly dominant strategy.\n\n",
