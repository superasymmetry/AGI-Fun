We always meet up in either building 45 or building 52 at MIT, and I know he'll go to one of those buildings right now.\n\n*   If we both go to building 45, we'll find each other.\n*   If we both go to building 52, we'll find each other.\n*   If I go to building 45 and he goes to building 52, I don't find him, and I feel slightly annoyed because building 45 is closer to my house.\n*   If I go to building 52 and he goes to building 45, I don't find him, and I'm fine with it.\n\nWhich building should I go to?\n\n**Explanation of Weak Dominance**\n\n*   **Players:** Me, My Brother\n*   **Strategies:** Go to Building 45, Go to Building 52\n*   **Payoffs:**  In this case, the payoff is finding each other and minimizing annoyance.\n\nLet's create a payoff matrix (from *my* perspective):\n\n|            | Brother: Building 45 | Brother: Building 52 |\n|------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n| **Me: Building 45** | Find Him          | Don't Find Him (Annoyed)       |\n| **Me: Building 52** | Don't Find Him       | Find Him       |\n\n**Why Building 45 weakly dominates Building 52:**\n\n*   **If my brother goes to Building 45:** Going to Building 45 is *better* than going to Building 52 (Finding him is better than not finding him).\n*   **If my brother goes to Building 52:** Going to Building 45 is *at least as good as* going to Building 52 (Not finding him but being annoyed is better than not finding him).\n\nSince going to building 45 is strictly better in one case, and at least as good in the other, building 45 weakly dominates building 52. Therefore, going to building 45 is the optimal solution.\n",
