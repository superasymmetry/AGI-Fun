    "inferences": "To make this scenario *not* an instance of weak dominance, we need to change the preferences such that neither strategy (going to building 45 or building 52) weakly dominates the other. Currently, going to Building 52 weakly dominates going to building 45. This is because:\n\n*   If your brother goes to Building 52, you strictly prefer going to Building 52 (meeting your brother) than going to Building 45 (being alone).\n*   If your brother goes to Building 45, you are indifferent between going to Building 52 (being alone) and going to Building 45 (meeting your brother).\n\nHere's a modified scenario that eliminates weak dominance:\n\n**Modified Scenario:**\n\nI'm trying to meet up with my brother in Cambridge, but his phone just died and I cannot reach him. We always meet up in either building 45 or building 52 at MIT, and I know he'll go to one of those buildings right now.\n\n*   If I meet my brother, I prefer to meet him in building 52.\n*   I *strongly dislike* being alone in building 52 - it's always freezing! I'd rather be alone in Building 45, where it's at least warm.\n\n**Explanation of why this removes Weak Dominance:**\n\n*   **If my brother goes to Building 52:** I strictly prefer to go to Building 52 (meet him) than to go to Building 45 (be alone).\n*   **If my brother goes to Building 45:** I strictly prefer to go to Building 45 (meet him) than to go to Building 52 (be alone, cold).\n\nNow, neither strategy weakly dominates the other. If you think he's more likely to be in Building 52, you should go there. If you think he's more likely to be in Building 45, you should go there.  Your decision depends on your *belief* about his actions, rather than one strategy being better than the other regardless of his action.\n",
