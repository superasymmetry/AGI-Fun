In this case, since both players (you and your brother) are indifferent between the two buildings as long as you meet, we can assign the same payoff for meeting and a lower payoff for not meeting. \n\nHere, the weakly dominant strategy would be for both players to choose the same building (either one), as it guarantees a meeting (higher payoff) regardless of the other's choice. Choosing the other building does not guarantee a meeting and is weakly dominated. \n\nHere\u2019s the payoff matrix representing this:\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (1, 1), (0, 0) ],\n [ (0, 0), (1, 1) ]]\n</OUTPUT>",
