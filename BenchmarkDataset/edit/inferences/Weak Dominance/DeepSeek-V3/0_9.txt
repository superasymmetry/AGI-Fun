    "inferences": "To create an instance of Weak Dominance, we need to adjust the payoffs so that one strategy weakly dominates another for at least one player. In the original scenario, advertising is strictly dominated by not advertising (since advertising costs $35 million, making it worse in all cases). \n\nTo introduce weak dominance, we can modify the payoffs such that advertising is at least as good as not advertising in all scenarios and strictly better in at least one scenario for one player. Here\u2019s the adjusted payoff matrix where advertising weakly dominates not advertising for both players:\n\n[[ ( -5, -5 ), ( 15, 0 ) ],\n [ ( 0, 15 ), ( 10, 10 ) ]]\n\nIn this matrix:\n- If both advertise, both incur the $35 million cost but gain $30 million in sales, resulting in -$5 million each.\n- If one advertises and the other doesn\u2019t, the advertiser gains $50 million in sales but pays $35 million, netting $15 million, while the non-advertiser gets $0.\n- If neither advertises, both get $10 million in sales with no cost.\n\nHere, advertising weakly dominates not advertising because:\n- For Player 1: \n  - If Player 2 advertises: -5 >= -5 (equal).\n  - If Player 2 doesn\u2019t advertise: 15 >= 10 (strictly better).\n- For Player 2, the same logic applies symmetrically.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ ( -5, -5 ), ( 15, 0 ) ],\n [ ( 0, 15 ), ( 10, 10 ) ]]\n</OUTPUT>",
