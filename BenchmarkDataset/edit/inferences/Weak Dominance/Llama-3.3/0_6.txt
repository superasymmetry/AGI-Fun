    "inferences": "To change the given example to make it not an instance of the Weak Dominance concept, we need to ensure that there is no strategy that yields a better or equal payoff for one player regardless of the other player's action. \n\nIn the original payoff matrix:\n- For the player, choosing A yields 4 when the computer chooses A and 0 when the computer chooses B.\n- For the player, choosing B yields 2 when the computer chooses A and 0 when the computer chooses B.\n\nThe original matrix is:\n[[ (4, 7), (0, 3) ],\n [ (2, 2), (0, 1) ]]\n\nTo make it so that there is no weakly dominant strategy for either player, we need to adjust the payoffs such that no single action is always better or equal for one player, regardless of the other's action.\n\nLet's adjust the payoffs to create a new matrix where no strategy weakly dominates another for either player. A possible adjustment could involve making sure that each player has a situation where one action is better than the other, depending on the opponent's choice, but without creating a scenario where one action is always better or equal.\n\nFor example, we could adjust the payoffs so that:\n- Choosing A is better when the computer chooses A but worse when the computer chooses B for the player.\n- Choosing B is better when the computer chooses B but not always worse when the computer chooses A for the player.\n\nA new payoff matrix that meets these conditions and avoids weak dominance could be:\n[[ (4, 7), (1, 3) ],\n [ (3, 2), (0, 1) ]]\n\nHowever, we must verify if this adjustment indeed removes weak dominance. In this new matrix:\n- For the player, A yields 4 against the computer's A and 1 against the computer's B.\n- For the player, B yields 3 against the computer's A and 0 against the computer's B.\n\nThis adjustment does not create a clear weakly dominant strategy since the preference between A and B for the player now depends on the computer's action, and neither A nor B is always better or equal.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (4, 7), (1, 3) ],\n [ (3, 2), (0, 1) ]]",
