    "inferences": "To create an instance of the Weak Dominance concept, we need to adjust the payoffs so that one strategy is at least as good as another strategy, regardless of what the other player chooses, but not strictly better. \n\nLet's consider the payoffs:\n- If both firms advertise, they both get $30 million in sales, but advertising costs $35 million, so the net payoff is -$5 million.\n- If one firm advertises but the other firm does not, then the company that advertises gets $50 million in sales, but advertising costs $35 million, so the net payoff is $15 million. The other company gets no sales, so the net payoff is $0 million (since there are no costs).\n- If both firms don\u2019t advertise, then both firms get $10 million dollars in sales, with no costs.\n\nNow, let's adjust these payoffs to create an instance of Weak Dominance. We want one strategy to be at least as good as another, regardless of what the other player chooses. \n\nFor Player 1 (my firm), not advertising will result in a payoff of $10 million if the other firm also doesn't advertise, and $0 million if the other firm advertises. For Player 1, advertising will result in a payoff of -$5 million if the other firm also advertises, and $15 million if the other firm doesn't advertise.\n\nHowever, to make this an instance of Weak Dominance, let's adjust the payoffs so that not advertising is at least as good as advertising, regardless of what the other firm chooses. \n\nIf both firms advertise, the payoff is (-5, -5). If one firm advertises but the other firm does not, then the company that advertises gets (15, 0) or (0, 15). If both firms don\u2019t advertise, then both firms get (10, 10).\n\nNow, let's adjust the payoffs so that not advertising is weakly dominant. We can do this by making the payoff for not advertising at least as good as the payoff for advertising, regardless of what the other firm chooses.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (15, 0), (10, 10) ],\n [ (0, 15), (10, 10) ]]",
