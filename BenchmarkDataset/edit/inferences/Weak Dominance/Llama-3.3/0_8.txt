    "inferences": "To make this example not an instance of the Weak Dominance concept, we need to adjust the payoffs so that neither advertising nor not advertising is a weakly dominant strategy for both firms. \n\nIn the original example, advertising is a weakly dominant strategy because, regardless of what the other firm does, advertising gives a higher or equal payoff ($50 million - $30 million = $20 million if the other firm doesn't advertise, and $30 million - $30 million = $0 million if the other firm does advertise, compared to $0 million if the firm doesn't advertise and the other firm does, and $10 million if neither firm advertises).\n\nLet's adjust the payoffs so that this is no longer the case. For instance, we could make the payoff for both firms advertising ($20 million, $20 million), the payoff for one firm advertising and the other not ($40 million, $0 million), and the payoff for both firms not advertising ($25 million, $25 million). \n\nWith these payoffs, neither advertising nor not advertising is a weakly dominant strategy, because the best choice depends on what the other firm chooses. \n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (40-30,0), (20,20) ],\n [ (0,40-30), (25,25) ]]",
