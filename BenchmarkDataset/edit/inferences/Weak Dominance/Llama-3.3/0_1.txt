    "inferences": "To create an instance of the Weak Dominance concept, we need to modify the example so that one option is at least as good as the other in all possible scenarios, but better in at least one scenario. \n\nIn this case, let's modify the wait times for the two locations. Suppose the wait time in the Harvard Square cafe is always 5 minutes, and the wait time in the Central Square cafe varies between 5 and 3 minutes, depending on where other people choose to eat, but with a probability of 0.5 for each. However, to make it a game theory problem, we'll introduce another player whose decision affects the wait time.\n\nLet's say Player 1 chooses between the Harvard Square cafe (H) and the Central Square cafe (C), and Player 2 chooses between going to the same cafe as Player 1 (S) or going to the other cafe (O). The payoffs will be the negative of the wait times, so a higher payoff means a shorter wait.\n\nIf both players choose the same cafe (H, S or C, S), the wait time is 5 minutes for Harvard Square and 5 minutes for Central Square. If Player 1 chooses Harvard Square and Player 2 chooses the other cafe (H, O), the wait time for Player 1 is 5 minutes, and if Player 1 chooses Central Square and Player 2 chooses the other cafe (C, O), the wait time for Player 1 is 3 minutes.\n\nHere is the payoff matrix:\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ ( -5, -5 ), ( -5, -3 ) ],\n [ ( -5, -5 ), ( -3, -5 ) ]]",
