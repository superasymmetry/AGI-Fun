    "inferences": "To change the given example so that it's not an instance of the Weak Dominance concept, we need to ensure that neither option is always better than the other, regardless of what the other players choose. In this case, the other \"players\" are the people choosing where to eat, which affects the wait time.\n\nInitially, the Harvard Square cafe has a fixed 5-minute wait, while the Central Square cafe has a variable wait between 5 and 10 minutes. This means that going to the Harvard Square cafe is a weakly dominant strategy because it guarantees a wait that is never worse than the Central Square cafe, which can have a longer wait.\n\nTo make it so that neither option is weakly dominant, we could introduce variability into the Harvard Square cafe's wait time as well, or adjust the wait times so that each cafe has scenarios where it is preferable over the other, depending on the actions of others (in this case, the wait times at each cafe).\n\nFor example, let's say the wait at Harvard Square can be either 0 or 10 minutes, and the wait at Central Square can be either 5 minutes if most people go to Harvard Square or 0 minutes if most people go to Central Square. This creates a situation where the best choice depends on what most people decide, making neither option weakly dominant.\n\nHere's a payoff matrix representing this situation, where the payoffs are the negative of the wait times (so higher payoffs are better), and we consider two players (you and the collective action of others) making choices:\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (0,0), (5,5) ],\n [ (10,10), (0,0) ]]",
