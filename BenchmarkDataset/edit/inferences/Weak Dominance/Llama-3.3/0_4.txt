    "inferences": "To change the given example so that it's not an instance of the Weak Dominance concept, we need to ensure that there's no strategy that is at least as good as every other strategy in all possible situations. In the context of the modified rock-paper-scissors game, let's adjust the payoffs so that no single strategy dominates the others under all circumstances.\n\nInitially, the payoffs are as follows:\n- If at least one of us plays scissors, then we both get 0 points.\n- If one person plays rock and the other plays paper, the person playing rock wins 3 points, and the person playing paper wins 2 points.\n- If we both play rock, we both win 4 points.\n- If we both play paper, we both win 1 point.\n\nLet's modify these rules to eliminate weak dominance. We can achieve this by making sure that each strategy has scenarios where it is the best choice and scenarios where it is not, depending on the opponent's move. \n\nFor instance, we could adjust the payoffs so that playing rock is not always better than playing paper when the opponent plays paper, and similarly, adjust other payoffs to balance the strategies. However, given the constraints of the game and the requirement to avoid weak dominance, we need to ensure that no strategy is always better than another regardless of the opponent's action.\n\nGiven the conditions, let's represent the game with a payoff matrix where the rows represent Player 1's actions (Rock and Paper) and the columns represent Player 2's actions (Rock and Paper), and we'll adjust the payoffs to fit the modified rules:\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (4,4), (3,2) ],\n [ (2,3), (1,1) ]]",
