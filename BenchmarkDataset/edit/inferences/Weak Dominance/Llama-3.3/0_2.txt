    "inferences": "To change the example so that it's not an instance of the Weak Dominance concept, we need to ensure that there's no strategy that is at least as good as every other strategy in every possible situation. In the context of the given scenario, this means that going to one building should not always yield a better or equal payoff than going to the other building, regardless of where the brother goes.\n\nLet's assign payoffs to reflect the preferences described:\n\n- Being with the brother in building 45: (3, 3) - moderate payoff for both, as they get to meet but it's not the preferred location for the speaker.\n- Being with the brother in building 52: (4, 3) - higher payoff for the speaker because they prefer building 52, but the brother's payoff remains the same as he's indifferent to the location as long as they meet.\n- Being alone in building 45: (1, 2) - low payoff for the speaker, as they don't get to meet their brother and are in the less preferred location.\n- Being alone in building 52: (3, 2) - moderate payoff for the speaker because they like building 52, even though they don't meet their brother.\n\nHowever, to ensure this doesn't represent a weak dominance scenario, we need to adjust these payoffs so that there's no clear dominant strategy (going to one building is always better than going to the other, regardless of the brother's choice). \n\nFor instance, if the payoffs were such that going to building 52 always resulted in a higher payoff for the speaker regardless of the brother's action, then going to building 52 would be weakly dominant. To avoid this, we can adjust the payoffs so that each location has a scenario where it's preferable, depending on the brother's choice.\n\nLet's adjust the payoffs to reflect a scenario where neither strategy (going to building 45 or building 52) is weakly dominant:\n\n- Being with the brother in building 45: (3, 3)\n- Being with the brother in building 52: (4, 3)\n- Being alone in building 45: (2, 2)\n- Being alone in building 52: (2, 2)\n\nThis adjustment means that the speaker prefers meeting their brother in either location over being alone but has a slight preference for meeting in building 52. However, being alone in either building gives the same payoff, removing the weak dominance of one strategy over the other.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (3, 3), (2, 2) ],\n [ (2, 2), (4, 3) ]]",
