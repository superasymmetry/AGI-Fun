Here's how we can modify it to a 2x2 game (removing scissors) where neither strategy weakly dominates the other:\n\nLet's keep Rock vs Rock at (4,4)\nLet's change Paper vs Paper to (3,3)\nAnd modify Paper vs Rock to (2,1)\n\nThis way:\n- Rock gives 4 against Rock but only 1 against Paper\n- Paper gives 3 against Paper but 2 against Rock\n\nNeither strategy weakly dominates the other because:\n- Rock is better against Rock (4 > 2)\n- Paper is better against Paper (3 > 1)\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (4,4), (1,2) ],\n [ (2,1), (3,3) ]]",
