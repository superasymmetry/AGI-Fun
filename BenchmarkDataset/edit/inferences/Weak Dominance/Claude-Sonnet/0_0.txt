    "inferences": "Let me help modify this example to remove weak dominance.\n\nIn the original scenario, going to Harvard Square weakly dominates going to Central Square because:\n- Harvard Square always has a 5-minute wait\n- Central Square has a wait of 5-10 minutes\n- Therefore, Harvard Square is never worse and sometimes better than Central Square\n\nTo remove weak dominance, we need to make it so that neither option is consistently better than the other. Let's modify the waiting times so that each location has its own advantages in different scenarios:\n\n- Harvard Square: Wait varies between 3-8 minutes\n- Central Square: Wait varies between 2-7 minutes\n\nNow, in game theory matrix form, if we represent the payoffs as negative waiting times (since shorter waits are better):\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (-3,-3), (-8,-2) ],\n [ (-7,-7), (-2,-8) ]]",
