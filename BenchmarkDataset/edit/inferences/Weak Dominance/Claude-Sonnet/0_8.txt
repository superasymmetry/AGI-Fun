We can do this by:\n\n1. Making not advertising more profitable when the other player doesn't advertise\n2. Making advertising more profitable when the other player advertises\n\nThis will create a coordination game where there's no dominated strategy.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[(20,20), (0,15)],\n [(15,0), (25,25)]]",
