We can do this by:\n   - Making building 45 strictly better in some scenarios\n   - Making building 52 strictly better in other scenarios\n\n4) Let's modify the payoffs so that:\n   - Being with brother in 45 is better than being alone in 52\n   - Being with brother in 52 is better than being alone in 45\n   - Being alone in either building is worse than being together\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (3,3), (0,1) ],\n [ (1,0), (4,4) ]]",
