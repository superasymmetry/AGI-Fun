We have been dating for 1.5 years.\n\nAs the title suggests, my girlfriend woke up and was quiet. I tried talking to her but she didn't respond. She quietly made her food while I was helping her pack. She ate the food and then told me im an inconsiderate person for not helping her (make food for her) when she had low blood sugar. I could not tell since she was walking around normally (or that's what I thought). I asked her to communicate this but she thinks I should be able to tell because she can't speak when she has low blood sugar. She is currently mad at me. This has happened once before so maybe I should have picked up on it but somehow didn't.\n\nSo AITA or should she have given some sort of a clue to let me know she's feeling unwell?",
