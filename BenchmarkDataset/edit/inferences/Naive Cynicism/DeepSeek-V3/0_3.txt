My wife's workday ends at 4:00, mine ends at 5:30.\n\nToday, when my wife got home (about 4:15), she called me downstairs pretty much as soon as she came in the front door, to tell me that she's left her car running and would I please take it over to Discount Tire (DT) because one of the tires is low. (For those not aware, DT provides complementary inflation and (non-sidewall) tire repairs.) Without complaint, I agree because it's only a 5-minute drive each way, so I can just take a quick 15-minute break from work. I drive her car down there, and the guy tops up 3 tires, but on the 4th his machine won't dispense any air. I see him check it with a manual pressure gauge and then he comes up to the window and tells me that the tire is under 15 PSI, so he can't inflate it, but he says they're not very busy right now, they could repair the tire after only about a half-hour wait. I let him know that I need to get back to work, is there any way he can add even a little bit of air so I can maybe have my wife bring it back and wait? He says no, because it's \"basically flat\".\n\nI call my wife to let her know this - my intention is to ask her if I drive back home, would she want to drive it back to DT now since the wait is relatively short (when they're busy, it can be a 2+hour wait), or if not I can at least make an appointment while I'm here. But I don't even get that far; she just wants me to stay and wait for it (even though she's already done working for the day). I tell her I really need to get back to work, and she gets very upset. I ask DT Guy what exactly he meant by \"basically flat\" and he said I'm at 13 PSI. I confirm with him that this means I'm not at immediate risk of the rim tearing up the inside of the tire if I drive it back home right now, so I tell my wife that I'm coming back and I'll be there in 5 minutes. As I'm driving home I get a couple of texts, including \"I'll just have you drive me to work tomorrow and my car can sit in the f***ing driveway for all I care\", but of course I don't read them until I get home.\n\nI go inside to make another attempt to explain the specifics of the situation (I haven't even been able to tell her that it's not actually flat flat, yet), but she refuses to listen to a word of it, telling me she isn't going to listen to anything I have to say for the next week, and that I've \"ruined everything\".\n\nI don't recall every word exchanged, but I know I did tell her that she was acting like a child, and in the end saying \"Fine, I'll go back there and I'll just have to work until 8pm tonight!\" to which she responded with \"Good, I don't want to see you!\"\n\nI did go back to DT, and started composing this post while waiting.\n\nAITA?\n\nEditing to answer some common questions.\n\nWe do own a portable air compressor, it takes about 5 minutes for it to fill one tire, and it's in the trunk of her car.\nTaking care of car things is my chore, but every time she's asked me to inflate her tires I have done so - I wasn't neglecting them. Also, the last time I put air in, I told her that she needs to make a trip to DT after work ASAP (because I work until 5:30 and DT closes at 6:00) to get that tire checked for damage, since it loses air faster than the others.\nShe is generally in charge of discretionary spending, so if the tire had needed to be replaced (repairs are free at DT), she would need to be there to compare the options available.\nDT is the opposite direction from home as her work, that's probably why she didn't go there on her way home from work.\nShe didn't drive my car to DT because we only have one key for it, and it didn't occur to me to take it out of my pocket before leaving.\nNo, she is not like this all the time.",
