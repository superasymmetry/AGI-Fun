She\u2019s like this everyone except for her best friend Marie.\n\nAbove all else, she is super super possessive about her phone, she\u2019s never showed me any of her photos or anything, she always takes her phone with her, she has one of those advanced passcodes, and she always turns her phone away from my direction, and just acts a little sus in general.\n\nThis has caused me lots of mental torture, as I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, if she even likes me, I keep on thinking I\u2019m not good enough for her, and it just feels weird that she\u2019s so cautious around me.",
