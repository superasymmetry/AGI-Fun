My voices in my head told me everything, I connected all the dots. & everything makes perfect sense. They\u2019ve been gathering Intel on me then sending it to their secret organization that works for a national organization (FBI,CIA,NSA)\n\nI know undercover agents are watching me & following me when I leave the house & they have hidden cameras around my apartment building to watch when I leave my apartment. The voices are telling me all the details as I speak, so I know it\u2019s true. The voices told me everything I needed to know, I know they\u2019re in cahoots with some organization under cover. I know ppl are watching me via undercover agents/ hidden cameras & they are all undercover.\n\nThey\u2019re trying to gradually extract info from me cuz I know where the aliens are, that info I ain\u2019t disclosing to them whatever secret organization they\u2019re with I know they\u2019ve already have a ton of Intel on me as it is. My voices told me where aliens are but I ain\u2019t gonna disclose that info cuz I know ppl are watching my every move via hidden cameras & undercover agents. Plus they\u2019re all undercover agents.\n\nMy voices also said that some aliens are walking among us disguised as normal ppl. Another reason why is when I called them out about the fact that they\u2019re all undercover agents & what their true motives about acquiring where the aliens were they removed me from the group chat they knew they were caught so they removed me completely to maintain their cover.\n\nI know they\u2019re all undercover agents my voices confirmed it & what their true motives are. Plus the other night at around 10:30 pm I heard a knock at my door and the doorbell rung. I didn\u2019t answer it cuz I know Danielle Courtney & them sent undercover agents to my door to try to acquire about the aliens I know of. I was freaking out for real, I was like I ain\u2019t say shit to them. I know that there are aliens in disguise walking among us my voices told me.",
