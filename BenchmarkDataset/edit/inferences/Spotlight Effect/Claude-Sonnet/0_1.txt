    "example": "So we talked, and I cried a bit but explained how I felt, asked how he felt and if there was any more to this than he was telling me. He assured me there wasn\u2019t, and he is just worried because he wants us & our kids especially to have the best possible day, and he just feels these things are red flags that we could be paying for a wedding that is sub par and he feels I deserve the best.\n\nHe isn\u2019t always the best at communicating verbally, sometimes just saying stuff in a way that sounds really blunt and doesn\u2019t realise at the time that some people (like me) won\u2019t understand the meaning behind his words unless he says it which sometimes causes panic in me bc I need context.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 is very sweet, but he just kind of assumes that bc I know him, I must of course know that he would never get cold feet about marrying me and that he wants to give me the moon on a stick- and therefore there is no possible way I could misunderstand the words \u2018I need to think about if I want to get married there\u2019 as him suggesting we postpone due to cold feet\u2026\n\nChat I love this big doofus :\u2019) thank you for all your responses I appreciate them all\n\nSo, I will start by saying I love this man so much, for so many reasons. He is my muse, my confidant, he encourages me and builds my confidence, I have never felt so free as I do now bc he not only isn\u2019t controlling but encourages me to go live my own life too so I go on holiday with my friends sometimes rather than just with him, plenty of nights out etc. He stands up for me, he is an amazing Dad to his and my kid, he is a bit fruity and gay which is great bc so am I, he is safe, he smells good, like I could list so many things I love about him. We don\u2019t argue- we talk stuff out.\n\nBut last night he started looking through the latest email from the wedding venue that I forwarded and now- 3 months before the wedding, he is saying he\u2019s unhappy with loads of stuff that he wishes he\u2019d known before we booked it, such as the fact there aren\u2019t toilets so they use portaloos (it is a historical site and listed so I understand this) and that the sound system only uses a spotify playlist. He asked how much I paid for the deposit (I paid that and he paid for other stuff we are going halves on the wedding) and suggested he might want to postpone it and find another venue. I feel like we\u2019ve it\u2019s too late to stop now because we\u2019ve already put in so much. Chat I am DEVASTATED. I honestly don\u2019t give a single care about the portaloos or the sound system. I just want to get married to him and have a great day. The kids are excited, I have invited guests, I have a suit, I have a photographer, everything is in place.\n\nIt\u2019s a small budget wedding, it\u2019s only our little family and some close friends.\n\nI feel like he is being overly fussy, but he feels he\u2019s being reasonable.",

    "label": "no",
    "inferences": "\"Everyone is going to notice how cheap these portaloos look and judge us for it.\"\n\nThis line of dialogue would clearly demonstrate the Spotlight Effect - the tendency to overestimate how much other people notice and care about our actions or appearances. It would show that the fianc\u00e9 is overly concerned about what guests might think about details that most people likely wouldn't focus on or remember after the wedding."
