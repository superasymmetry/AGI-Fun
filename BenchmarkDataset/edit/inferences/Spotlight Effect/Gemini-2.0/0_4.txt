    "example": "In my (F18) country 18th birthday is special because it is the legal age. It's typical to have a bigger party, family celebration or other thing like that. As it happened, on the day of my birthday was my close cousin's wedding, an event which my whole family had (and wanted) to attend.\n\nI had no problem with that. My cousin had a whole big event to plan while being tight on budget and if the place she wanted was free on the date of my birthday, then so be it (she wanted for her wedding to take place in a rather picturesque place which is almost always reserved, so she had to take any date which was free). I planned with my parents that we'll celebrate my birthday one week later and that they'll let me hit a club with some of my friends an evening after the wedding as a sort of late celebration. I was actually very happy with this solution.\n\nOn the day of my birthday my parents sang me \"happy birthday\", gave symbolic gifts and off we went for the wedding. Everything was going great but at one point during reception my mother started silencing the band, got the microphone and told to the whole family that my 18th birthday is today and that they have to sing me \"happy birthday\". She and dad also proceeded to give me big gifts AND a special torte which I was sure I'll receive only one week later.\n\nIt was horrendously awkward, both for me and the guests, half of whom I didn't even know. I felt humiliated and like I destroyed my cousin's (with whom I'm very close) wedding. I firmly believe that one shouldn't make another person's big day about themselves and I never, ever wanted my parents to pull something like that. I spent rest of the reception hiding in the corner, hoping that nobody thinks that I really wanted my parents to do a scene during the reception.\n\nWhen we returned from the reception, my parents were beaming at me, proud of the surprise they did for me and basically they wanted me to praise and thank them. They also said that they called of the celebration next week, since I had \"such a big moment\" on the wedding day.\n\nI honestly told them that I was feeling humiliated, that I'd really prefer a smaller celebration at home than forced \"happy birthday\" from the crowd and that I feel like they ruined both my birthday and, what's more important, my cousin's wedding.\n\nNeedless to say they're mad at me and say that I'm ungrateful, spoiled brat.\n\nAITA?",
