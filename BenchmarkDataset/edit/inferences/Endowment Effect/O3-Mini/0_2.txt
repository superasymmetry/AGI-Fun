For me, giving gifts isn\u2019t about the price tag, it\u2019s about showing the other person positive regard.\n\nThis evening, I visited my mother\u2019s home for the family holiday (siblings, mother, in-laws, nieces/nephews). Just a sample of what I brought for people: stained glass window art, handmade porcelain bowls, and handmade silver jewelry.\n\nI wasn\u2019t expecting much tbh, I honestly do enjoy giving gifts, but if I had received no gifts, I\u2019d have been fine with that. While I do enjoy receiving gifts, it isn\u2019t a quid pro quo situation.\n\nBut these fricking family members did something worse. Like, a Starbucks gift card and a hot chocolate gift basket. The kind of presents that say \u201cI put zero time/effort into this.\u201d At best, I can bring these things to an office party or something like that.\n\nWhen I noticed the incongruence, I just started feeling like a complete fool. As soon as I could slip away, I drove home. I didn\u2019t flip out or say anything dumb, but I feel like I was being laughed at, the butt of some joke.\n\nNow I\u2019m home, just feel shitty and frustrated.\n\nIf someone reading this post has an alternative narrative that I can use, I\u2019d love to hear it.\n\nThanks.\n",
