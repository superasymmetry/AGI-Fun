Not for having a stuffed animal at my age and that I should \"grow up.\" I will be disgrading those comments.\n\nI(19f) am in college. I'm just finishing up my first year. 10 years ago, my first childhood friend gifted me a white teddy bear with a cute little black dress and a bow on her right ear. I always had her on my bed and I would take her on any vacations whenever I'm staying the night. It's been well known in my family that she's a sentimental item to me. My old friend and I don't speak anymore and we have lost touched, but I still kept the teddy bear.\n\nIn 5th grade, I was gifted a red, fluffy jacket from my grandma and I almost wore it everyday. That, too, became a sentimental item. However, after middle school, my mom decided to throw it away. I was extremely mad at her and didn't speak to her for a day or two. So this isn't the first time she threw away a sentimental item.\n\nNow, yesterday, I noticed my bear wasn't on my bed as normal. I searched around and just couldn't find her. She didn't fall underneath my bed and she didn't get up and just walk away. I asked my sister, but she didn't know. So then I asked my mom and she said she threw it away. I instantly panicked. I went over to the trash and saw its been taken it. I went into the garage and looked through the garbage bin and found it inside a trash bag. I ripped it open and took her out. She was so dirty, gross, and smelled so horrible. There was a lot of liquid all over her furr. I started to break down and went back upstairs. I yelled at my mom for doing this. She knew how special she was to me and she thought it was a good idea to throw it away since I was too old to be having stuffed animals. I cleaned her off in the bathroom sink, but she's still gross. Her white coat is now stained and I'm absolutely furious. She isn't the same anymore. I was ranting, crying, and slamming doors shut. My mom called my dad and after he got home from work, he yelled at me for screaming at my mother. I got grounded and they took my laptop away. I only managed to convince them to keep my phone was because of work and I needed my boss and co-workers to text me. My sister even commented on how I overreacted.\n\nThe whole ordeal lasted a fee hours of me sobbing and trying to clean her to the best of my abilities. She's back on my bed, but my sister is annoyed, my mom is crying, and my dad is angry at me. I'm not too sure if I did overreact or not. Everyone in the household is annoyed at the tantrum I threw. I texted one of my friends and he has my back, but my whole family doesn't like me right now. I don't know what to do. I'm tired and exhausted from the judgemental stares. Did I overreact? AITA for causing an unnecessary scene and making it bigger than it is?",
