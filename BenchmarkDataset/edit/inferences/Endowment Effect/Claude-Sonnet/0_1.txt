When I noticed, I made a comment about how long he\u2019s had the pillows and apparently he\u2019s been using them since he was a kid.\n\nSo, I asked him if he had any other pillows and he said he just had the pillow on the left of the first picture, but that his cat usually sleeps on it. I said I don\u2019t really want to sleep on those pillows, and id prefer to sleep at my own place (with clean pillows).\n\nHis response? He waited for a minute and then said he would be sad to see that I would choose something as small as pillows come between us spending the night together, but that if I needed to go, that he understood.\n\nI ended up going home and spending the night at my own house instead. I asked if I could bring my own pillows and gently suggested he get rid of his. He said it was totally fine for me to bring a pillow, but that he wouldn\u2019t get rid of his, as they are \u2018sentimental\u2019.\n\nThoughts? I feel like I can\u2019t even kiss him or anything while we\u2019re sleeping because I don\u2019t want him to get his gross pillowness all over me and my clean pillows. \ud83d\ude02",
