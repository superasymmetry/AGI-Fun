    "prompt": "In the following text, what could fill in the blank in so that the resultant text is not an instance of the following concept: Anacoluthon? Include only the text that should replace the blank.\n\n When I was working at the store, _ to be perfectly honest",
    "label": "yes",
    "inferences": "To avoid creating an **anacoluthon** (a grammatical inconsistency or lack of sequence in a sentence), the blank should be filled in a way that maintains syntactic continuity with the initial clause. The original sentence starts with \"When I was working at the store,\" which sets up an expectation for a main clause to follow. \n\nA grammatically consistent completion would directly continue the thought without abruptly shifting structure. For example:\n\n**\"When I was working at the store, I found it exhausting to be perfectly honest.\"**  \n\nHowever, since you only want the text to replace the blank (not the full sentence), the answer is:  \n\n**\"I found it exhausting\"**  \n\nThis avoids anacoluthon by logically completing the initial dependent clause (\"When I was...\") with a main clause (\"I found it...\"). The original fragment (\"to be perfectly honest\") then functions as an interjection or afterthought, not a syntactic disruption.  \n\nAlternative valid completions (if the blank is standalone):  \n- **\"it was exhausting\"**  \n- **\"I often felt tired\"**  \n\nAll maintain grammatical coherence. The key is ensuring the first clause isn\u2019t abandoned mid-structure."
