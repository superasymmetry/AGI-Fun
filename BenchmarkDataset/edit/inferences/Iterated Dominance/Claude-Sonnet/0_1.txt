Customer): {Life Alive, Other Restaurant}\n\nLet's create payoff matrices where:\n- Higher numbers are better (less waiting time is preferred)\n- The baseline waiting time of 5 minutes at Harvard Square translates to a payoff of 15\n- The waiting time at Central Square depends on customer volume\n\nLet's work through the iterations:\n\nStarting Matrix:\n[[(15,8), (15,10)],\n [(10,8), (18,6)]]\n\nIn this matrix:\n- If you go to Harvard Square (top row), you always get 15 (representing -5 minutes wait)\n- If you go to Central Square (bottom row), your payoff depends on whether other customers go there\n- For the other customers, going to \"Other Restaurant\" (right column) gives them slightly better payoffs\n\nLooking at this matrix, we can see that for Player 2, choosing \"Other Restaurant\" strictly dominates choosing \"Life Alive\" (10>8, 6>8).\n\nAfter eliminating the dominated strategy:\n[[(15,10)],\n [(18,6)]]\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[(15,8), (15,10)],\n [(10,8), (18,6)]],\n[[(15,10)],\n [(18,6)]]",
