To alter the situation so that no options are strictly dominated, we simply need your brother's preference to either not be exclusively against building 52 or modify the conditions such that both locations have some appeal. For instance:\n\n---\n\nI'm trying to meet up with my brother in Cambridge, but his phone just died and I cannot reach him. We always meet up in either building 45 or building 52 at MIT. While my brother prefers building 45 because it's closer to the library, he doesn't hate building 52; in fact, he sometimes goes there for events. As for me, right now I just want to find my brother and I occasionally prefer building 52 since it\u2019s closer to the park. Which building should I go to in order to try and find my brother?\n\n---\n\nThrough this change, neither building is strictly dominated since both players now have reasons for choosing either location, and there is no clear sequential elimination of choices based on dominant strategies. \n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (3,2), (1,1), (0,3) ],\n [ (2,2), (2,2), (1,1) ],\n [ (0,3), (1,0), (4,4) ]],\n[[ (3,2), (1,1) ],\n [ (2,2), (2,2) ]],\n[[ (2,2), (2,2) ]]\n<OUTPUT>",
