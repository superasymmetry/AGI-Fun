    "inferences": "To create an instance of iterated dominance, we can adjust the payoff values such that there are strictly dominated strategies in the payoff matrix initially which can be eliminated through iterated elimination. Assume the player options are \"Advertise\" (A) and \"Not Advertise\" (NA). Here's a breakdown of how the adjusted game could look for iterated dominance savings:\n\n1. Initial Payoff Matrix:\n   - If both firms advertise, both incur their advertising costs ($35 million) and receive sales of $30 million, for a net loss of $5 million each.\n   - If one firm advertises and the other does not, the advertising firm gets net sales of $15 million ($50 million sales - $35 million cost), while the non-advertising firm gets $10 million.\n   - If neither advertises, both get $10 million in sales.\n\nPayoff Matrix:\n\n   [[(-5,-5), (15,10)],\n    [(10,15), (10,10)]]\n\nIn this setup, we can identify strictly dominated strategies:\n\n- For my firm: \"Advertise\" (A1) dominates \"Not Advertise\" (NA) if eliminating A due to low pay: (-5 < 10).\n- For the competitor: \"Advertise\" (A2) dominates \"Not Advertise\" (NA) for the same reason in reverse iteration.\n\nBy iterated elimination, we remove dominated strategies step by step. \n\nLet's rewrite and eliminate strategies step by step:\n\n1. Initial Matrix:\n   [[(-5,-5), (15,10)], \n    [(10,15), (10,10)]]\n\n2. Eliminate dominated strategies:\n- Assuming My Firm is Row Player and Competitor is Column Player:\n- For Row Player, Strategy \"Advertise\" (-5) is dominated by \"Not Advertise\" (10), so remove \"Advertise\".\n- For Column Player: \"Advertise\" is dominated by \"Not Advertise\" (10), with strictly higher pay, so remove \"Advertise\".\n\nAdjusted strategy matrix after one complete elimination:\n\n   [[(10,10)]]\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[(-5,-5), (15,10)], [(10,15), (10,10)]], [[(10,10)]]",
