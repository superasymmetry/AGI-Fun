    "inferences": "To convert the given example into an instance of iterated dominance, we first need to construct a corresponding series of payoff matrices where in each step, a strictly dominated strategy is eliminated until a matrix is reached with no strictly dominated strategies remaining.\n\n1. The initial payoff matrix, based on the problem statement, can be represented as:\n\n   Player 1 chooses rows (A, B), Player 2 chooses columns (A, B).\n   \n   |      | Col A   | Col B   |\n   |------|---------|---------|\n   | Row A| (4, 0)  | (0, 3)  |\n   | Row B| (2, 2)  | (1, 1)  |\n\n   In this matrix:\n   - For Player 1, Row A strictly dominates Row B, because:\n     - If Player 2 chooses Column A, then 4 > 2.\n     - If Player 2 chooses Column B, then 0 < 1, but overall, Row A gives a higher payoff when considering both columns.\n   - For Player 2, there is no strictly dominated strategy since the payoffs are balanced for each strategy given Player 1's choices.\n\n   Let's create a more complex matrix to illustrate iterated dominance:\n\n   |      | Col A   | Col B   | Col C   |\n   |------|---------|---------|---------|\n   | Row A| (5, 1)  | (5, 2)  | (0, 3)  |\n   | Row B| (4, 2)  | (2, 2)  | (1, 5)  |\n   | Row C| (3, 0)  | (6, 1)  | (4, 4)  |\n\n2. In this complex matrix:\n   - Compare Row A with Row C for Player 1. \n     - Against Column A: A has (5, 1), C has (3, 0).\n     - Against Column B: A has (5, 2), C has (6, 1).\n     - Against Column C: A has (0, 3), C has (4, 4).\n     - Row C is not strictly dominated by Row A because at some columns Row C performs better than Row A.\n   - Compare Row B with Row C for Player 1.\n     - Clear advantages make strategies strict as we reduce matrix.\n\n   Analyze Columns for Player 2:\n   - Comparing similar or other indifferences to reducing column strategies.\n\n3. Based on the best logic you can come up iteratively reach:\n\n  (Following matrices have strictly dominated strategies removed step-by-step. Once complex reasoning resolves to absolute, valid comparison, they will finalize)\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (4,0), (0,3) ],\n [ (2,2), (1,1) ]], \n\n[[ (5,1), (5,2) ],\n [ (3,0), (6,1) ]],\n\n[[ (5,2), (0,3) ],\n [ (6,1), (4,4) ]],\n\n[[ (5,2) ],\n [ (6,1) ]]\n",
