    "inferences": "To convert this example into an instance of iterated dominance in game theory, let's consider two players: Player 1 (You) and Player 2 (The set of 200 other customers). Each player makes a choice between two strategies: going to Life Alive at Harvard Square (H) or Life Alive at Central Square (C).\n\nFor Player 1, the payoff is inversely related to the waiting time: the less the waiting time, the higher the payoff. For Player 2, the payoff could be a simple representation based on a preference for one location over the other, or perhaps meeting more of their set.\n\nLet\u2019s simplify the problem with hypothetical numbers for Player 2's decision. Suppose Player 2 prefers Central Square but will face increasing costs as more people choose the same location (like a congestion cost).\n\nInitial Payoff Matrix:\n\\[ \n\\begin{array}{c|c|c}\n & \\text{H} & \\text{C} \\\\\n\\hline\n\\text{H} & (6,6) & (10,3) \\\\\n\\text{C} & (5,7) & (4,5) \\\\\n\\end{array} \n\\]\n\nWhere each cell \\((A_i, B_i)\\) represents the payoffs for Player 1 and Player 2 respectively. For example, if both choose H, both get 6. If Player 1 goes to C and Player 2 goes to H, Player 1 gets a payoff of 5 and Player 2 gets a payoff of 7.\n\nNow, let\u2019s perform iterated elimination of strictly dominated strategies:\n\n- Comparing rows for Player 1: If Player 2 selects H, Player 1 prefers C (10 over 6). If Player 2 selects C, Player 1 still prefers H (5 over 4). So for Player 1, C strictly dominates H.\n\nUpdate by removing dominated strategy for Player 1:\n\n\\[ \n\\begin{array}{c|c|}\n & \\text{C} \\\\\n\\hline\n\\text{H} & (10,3) \\\\\n\\text{C} & (4,5) \\\\\n\\end{array} \n\\]\n\n- Comparing columns for Player 2: If Player 1 selects C, Player 2 prefers H (5 over 3). Player 2 should always select H.\n\nUpdate by removing dominated strategy for Player 2:\n\nFinal Payoff Matrix:\n\\[ \n\\begin{array}{c|c|}\n\\text{C} & \\text{H} \\\\\n\\hline\n & \\\\\n(4,5) & \\\\\n\\end{array} \n\\]\n\nThis matrix now has no strictly dominated strategies remaining. \n\n<OUTPUT>\n\n[[ (6,6), (10,3), (5,7) ],\n [ (6,6), (10,3), (5,7) ],\n [ (6,6), (10,3), (5,7) ]], \n\n[[ (10,3), (4,5) ]],\n\n[[ (4,5) ]] \n\n<END>",
