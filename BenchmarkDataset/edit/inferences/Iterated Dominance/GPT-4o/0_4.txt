    "inferences": "To change the game and ensure it's not an instance of iterated dominance, we'll adjust the payoff matrix so that no strategies are strictly dominated. In iterated dominance, a strictly dominated strategy is one where another strategy always provides a higher payoff, regardless of the opponent's action.\n\nIn the given modified rock-paper-scissors game, redefine the payoffs to eliminate strict dominance. We will adjust the payoff for when one move is strictly better than others.\n\nOriginal game payoffs as given:\n- Scissors vs. Rock: Rock (-10, 0), Scissors (0, -10)\n- Scissors vs. Paper: Paper (1, 0), Scissors (0, 1)\n- Scissors vs. Scissors: (0, 0)\n- Rock vs. Paper: Rock (3, 2), Paper (2, 3)\n- Rock vs. Rock: (4, 4)\n- Paper vs. Paper: (1, 1)\n\nLet's create a situation where strategies are not strictly dominated by others:\n\nRevised game payoffs:\n- Scissors vs. Rock: Rock (0, 0), Scissors (0, 3)\n- Scissors vs. Paper: Paper (1, 0), Scissors (0, 1)\n- Scissors vs. Scissors: (2, 2)\n- Rock vs. Paper: Rock (2, 5), Paper (4, 2)\n- Rock vs. Rock: (3, 3)\n- Paper vs. Paper: (2, 2)\n\nNew payoff matrix:\n- If one person plays scissors and the other plays rock, both score 0 points, but if one person plays rock, they score 0, while scissors score 3 points.\n- If one person plays scissors and the other plays paper, scissors score 0, paper scores 1.\n- If both play scissors, both score 2 points.\n- If one person plays rock and the other plays paper, rock scores 2, paper scores 5.\n- If both play rock, both score 3 points.\n- If both play paper, both score 2 points.\n\nNow, none of the strategies can be eliminated through iterated elimination of strictly dominated strategies as each payoff option has situations where it could be beneficial. This way, no single strategy strictly dominates another, avoiding iterated dominance.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (2,2), (0,1), (0,3) ],\n [ (3,3), (2,5), (0,0) ],\n [ (4,2), (2,2), (2,2) ]]\n<OUTPUT>",
