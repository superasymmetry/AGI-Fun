    "inferences": "To modify the example into an instance of iterated dominance, we need to construct a payoff matrix where we can iteratively eliminate strictly dominated strategies. For iterated dominance, you'll need a payoff matrix for both players where certain strategies can be iteratively eliminated based on the idea that a rational player would never play a strictly dominated strategy.\n\nCurrently, the game is presented in a narrative format. We should convert it into numerical matrices. We can assume the payoff matrix configuration and then construct the game theory matrix that allows for iterated dominance.\n\nConsider the following potential payoff setup:\n\nLet us define the initial payoff matrix based on your description, but adjust it to ensure some strategies are strictly dominated:\n\nPlayer 1 / Player 2\n\n- Rock\n- Paper\n- Scissors\n\nInitial Payoff Matrix:\n```\nRock: (1,1), (3,2), (-10,0)\nPaper: (2,3), (1,1), (0,1)\nScissors: (0,-10), (0,0), (0,0)\n```\n\nNow, we can adjust this matrix so that iterated dominance can be applied, and ensure at each step one strategy can be strictly dominated.\n\nFirst Matrix (Initial State):\n```\n[[ (1,1), (-10,0), (0,5)],\n [ (3,2), (1,1), (0,0)],\n [ (0,0), (1,5), (4,4)]]\n```\n\nBy examining the strategies:\n- Scissors strictly dominates Rock for Player 1 as it offers higher payoffs in all comparisons.\n- For Player 2, against 'Scissors', 'Paper' offers better payoff compared to others.\n\nLet us eliminate dominated strategies in steps.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (1,1), (-10,0), (0,5)],\n [ (3,2), (1,1), (0,0)],\n [ (0,0), (1,5), (4,4)]],\n\n[[ (3,2), (0,0)],\n [ (1,5), (4,4)]]\n\n[[ (4,4)]]\n",
