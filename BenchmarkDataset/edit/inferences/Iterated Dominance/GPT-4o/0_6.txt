    "inferences": "In the provided game, \"Iterated Dominance\" implies that there are strategies that can be eliminated because they are strictly dominated by other strategies. A situation that doesn't exhibit iterated dominance would lack any such strictly dominated strategies.\n\nTo eliminate iterated dominance, we can adjust the payoffs of the strategies so that no strategy strictly dominates another for either player. Here's how we can modify the payoffs:\n\n- Ensure the payoffs are balanced such that no action strictly provides a higher payoff regardless of the opponent's action.\n\nFor example, consider the modified matrix:   \n- Actions (A, A) leads to payoffs (3, 4)\n- Actions (A, B) leads to payoffs (3, 2)\n- Actions (B, A) leads to payoffs (2, 3)\n- Actions (B, B) leads to payoffs (2, 2)\n\nIn this modified game:\n- For both players, no strategy is strictly better than another across all scenarios.\n\nNow, let\u2019s format this in a 2x2 matrix for clarifying and comparing with the previous setup:\n\nGiven:\n- Actions (A, A) led to payoffs (4, 7)\n- Actions (A, B) led to payoffs (0, 3)\n- Actions (B, A) led to payoffs (2, 2)\n- Actions (B, B) led to payoffs (1, 1)\n\nThis becomes:\n\n[[ (3,4), (3,2) ],\n [ (2,3), (2,2) ]]\n\nIn this matrix:\n- Player 1's actions: A or B\n- Player 2's actions: A or B\n\nThis new setup removes strict dominance by ensuring that both players face trade-offs without one clear path being superior in every condition.\n\nTo make it clearer, let\u2019s test for any dominance:\n- For Player 1, neither A strictly dominates B, nor does B strictly dominate A.\n- Similarly, for Player 2, neither A strictly dominates B, nor does B strictly dominate A.\n\nThus, this is not an instance where iterated dominance occurs, as strategy choices depend on the opponent's actions with no single strategy universally superior.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (4,7), (0,3) ],\n [ (2,2), (1,1) ]],\n[[ (3,4), (3,2) ],\n [ (2,3), (2,2) ]]\n<OUTPUT>",
