    "inferences": "To change the given example so that it is not an instance of iterated dominance, we need to ensure that there are no strictly dominated strategies that can be iteratively eliminated.\n\nInitially, let's represent the original situation as a payoff matrix with the options \"Advertise\" (A) and \"Not Advertise\" (N):\n\nMy firm / Competitor firm\n         A         N\nA    (30-35, 30-60)   (50-35, 0)\nN    (0, 50)                (10, 10)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n         A         N\nA    (-5, -30)   (15, 0)\nN    (0, 50)        (10, 10)\n\nIn this matrix, \"Not Advertise\" strictly dominates \"Advertise\" for both firms.\n\nTo ensure it is not an instance of iterated dominance, we can adjust the payoffs such that no strategy is strictly dominated. One way to do this:\n\nFor example, let's change the scenario as follows:\n\n- If both firms advertise, both get $25 million.\n- If one firm advertises, it gets $45 million, and the non-advertising firm gets $5 million.\n- If neither advertises, both earn $20 million.\n\nIn numerical terms, the cost of advertising remains unchanged for both firms. The new matrix becomes:\n\n         A         N\nA    (25-35, 25-60)   (45-35, 5)\nN    (5, 45)                (20, 20)\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n         A         N\nA    (-10, -35)    (10, 5)\nN    (5, 45)        (20, 20)\n\nIn this modified matrix, no strategy is strictly dominated; therefore, it is no longer an instance of iterated dominance.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (4,8), (9,1), (3,4) ],\n [ (2,7), (5,6), (8,2) ],\n [ (6,3), (7,5), (2,9) ]],\n[[ (9,1), (3,4) ],\n [ (5,6), (8,2) ]],\n[[ (9,1), (3,4) ]]",
