    "inferences": "To model this as an instance of iterated dominance, we first construct the payoff matrix for the game. The two players are \"My Firm\" and \"Competitor Firm,\" and each has two strategies: \"Advertise\" (A) or \"Not Advertise\" (N). The payoffs are calculated as follows:\n\n- If both advertise: Sales = $30M, Cost = $35M \u2192 Net payoff = $30M - $35M = -$5M for each firm.\n- If one advertises and the other does not: \n  - Advertiser: Sales = $50M, Cost = $35M \u2192 Net payoff = $50M - $35M = $15M.\n  - Non-advertiser: Sales = $0M, Cost = $0M \u2192 Net payoff = $0M.\n- If neither advertises: Sales = $10M, Cost = $0M \u2192 Net payoff = $10M for each firm.\n\nThe initial payoff matrix is:\n\n[[ (-5, -5), (15, 0) ],\n [ (0, 15), (10, 10) ]]\n\nNow, we apply iterated elimination of strictly dominated strategies:\n\n1. For \"My Firm\":\n   - If the competitor chooses \"Advertise,\" my payoff for \"Advertise\" is -5, and for \"Not Advertise\" is 0. So \"Not Advertise\" is better.\n   - If the competitor chooses \"Not Advertise,\" my payoff for \"Advertise\" is 15, and for \"Not Advertise\" is 10. So \"Advertise\" is better.\n   - Neither strategy strictly dominates the other for \"My Firm.\"\n\n2. For \"Competitor Firm\":\n   - The same logic applies symmetrically. Neither strategy strictly dominates the other for the competitor.\n\nSince no strategy is strictly dominated in the initial matrix, no further elimination is possible. The final matrix is the same as the initial one.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (-5, -5), (15, 0) ],\n [ (0, 15), (10, 10) ]]\n</OUTPUT>",
