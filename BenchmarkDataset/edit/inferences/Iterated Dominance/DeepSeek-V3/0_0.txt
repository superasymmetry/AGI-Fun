    "inferences": "To make this scenario not an instance of Iterated Dominance, we need to eliminate the aspect where one strategy strictly dominates another, regardless of the other players' choices. In the original scenario, the Harvard Square cafe has a fixed wait time (5 minutes), while the Central Square cafe's wait time depends on the number of customers (x/20 minutes). Since all 200 customers will choose the Central Square cafe (due to other restaurants having long lines), the wait time there is 200/20 = 10 minutes. Thus, Harvard Square (5 minutes) strictly dominates Central Square (10 minutes). \n\nTo remove Iterated Dominance, we can introduce uncertainty or interdependence that prevents one strategy from always being better. For example, we could make the wait time at Harvard Square also depend on the number of customers, or introduce variability in the customers' preferences. Here\u2019s a modified version:\n\n\"I'm trying to decide whether to have dinner at the Life Alive cafe in Harvard Square or the Life Alive cafe in Central Square. Both have the same menu, so all I care about is how long the wait will be at the restaurant. The wait time at the Harvard Square cafe depends on how many of the 100 regular Harvard Square customers choose to go there: if y customers go there, the wait time is y/10 minutes. The wait time at the Central Square cafe depends on how many of the 200 regular Central Square customers go there: if x customers go there, the wait time is x/20 minutes. Today, the other restaurants in both squares are equally appealing, so customers may split between Life Alive and other restaurants. Which location should I go to?\"\n\nIn this version, neither location strictly dominates the other because the wait times depend on the unpredictable choices of other customers, and neither strategy is always better. \n\nNow, here are the payoff matrices as requested, showing the elimination of strictly dominated strategies:\n\n[[ (5, 0), (10, 0) ],  \n [ (5, 0), (10, 0) ]],  \n\n[[ (5, 0) ]]  \n\n<OUTPUT>  \n[[ (5, 0), (10, 0) ],  \n [ (5, 0), (10, 0) ]],  \n[[ (5, 0) ]]  \n</OUTPUT>",
