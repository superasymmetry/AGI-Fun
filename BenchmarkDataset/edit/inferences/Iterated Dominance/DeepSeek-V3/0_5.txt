    "inferences": "To transform this into an instance of Iterated Dominance, we need to represent the game as a payoff matrix and then iteratively eliminate strictly dominated strategies. Here's the payoff matrix for the modified rock-paper-scissors game, where the rows represent your strategies and the columns represent Eric's strategies. The payoffs are given as (Your payoff, Eric's payoff):\n\nInitial Payoff Matrix:\n[[ (0, 0), (0, -10), (0, 1) ],   # Scissors vs Scissors, Rock, Paper\n [ (-10, 0), (1, 1), (3, 2) ],   # Rock vs Scissors, Rock, Paper\n [ (1, 0), (2, 3), (1, 1) ]]     # Paper vs Scissors, Rock, Paper\n\nNow, let's apply iterated elimination of strictly dominated strategies:\n\n1. First, observe that for Eric, playing Scissors is strictly dominated by Paper because:\n   - If you play Scissors: Scissors gives Eric 0, Paper gives Eric 1.\n   - If you play Rock: Scissors gives Eric 0, Paper gives Eric 2.\n   - If you play Paper: Scissors gives Eric 0, Paper gives Eric 1.\n   In all cases, Paper yields a higher payoff for Eric than Scissors. Thus, we can eliminate Scissors for Eric.\n\nReduced Payoff Matrix after eliminating Scissors for Eric:\n[[ (0, -10), (0, 1) ],   # Scissors vs Rock, Paper\n [ (1, 1), (3, 2) ],     # Rock vs Rock, Paper\n [ (2, 3), (1, 1) ]]     # Paper vs Rock, Paper\n\n2. Next, observe that for you, playing Scissors is strictly dominated by Rock because:\n   - If Eric plays Rock: Scissors gives you 0, Rock gives you 1.\n   - If Eric plays Paper: Scissors gives you 0, Rock gives you 3.\n   In both cases, Rock yields a higher payoff for you than Scissors. Thus, we can eliminate Scissors for you.\n\nReduced Payoff Matrix after eliminating Scissors for you:\n[[ (1, 1), (3, 2) ],   # Rock vs Rock, Paper\n [ (2, 3), (1, 1) ]]   # Paper vs Rock, Paper\n\n3. Now, observe that for Eric, playing Rock is strictly dominated by Paper because:\n   - If you play Rock: Rock gives Eric 1, Paper gives Eric 2.\n   - If you play Paper: Rock gives Eric 3, Paper gives Eric 1.\n   However, this is not strictly dominated because Paper does not always yield a higher payoff for Eric (e.g., if you play Paper, Rock is better for Eric). Thus, no further elimination is possible.\n\nFinal Payoff Matrix:\n[[ (1, 1), (3, 2) ],\n [ (2, 3), (1, 1) ]]\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (0, 0), (0, -10), (0, 1) ],\n [ (-10, 0), (1, 1), (3, 2) ],\n [ (1, 0), (2, 3), (1, 1) ]],\n[[ (0, -10), (0, 1) ],\n [ (1, 1), (3, 2) ],\n [ (2, 3), (1, 1) ]],\n[[ (1, 1), (3, 2) ],\n [ (2, 3), (1, 1) ]]",
