Here's a modified version where iterated dominance does not apply:\n\n---\n\nI'm trying to meet up with my brother in Cambridge, but his phone just died and I cannot reach him. We always meet up in one of three buildings at MIT: building 45, building 52, or building 10. My brother has no strong preference among the three buildings and is equally likely to go to any of them. Similarly, I have no preference and just want to find my brother, so I\u2019m equally likely to choose any of the three buildings. Which building should I go to in order to try and find my brother?\n\n---\n\nIn this version, no strategy is strictly dominated because no building is inherently worse for either player. Thus, iterated elimination of strictly dominated strategies cannot be applied.\n\nNow, here are the payoff matrices as requested, showing the elimination process (though the final scenario does not involve iterated dominance, the matrices illustrate the original concept):\n\n[[ (1,1), (0,0), (0,0) ],\n [ (0,0), (1,1), (0,0) ],\n [ (0,0), (0,0), (1,1) ]],\n\n[[ (1,1), (0,0) ],\n [ (0,0), (1,1) ]],\n\n[[ (1,1) ]]\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (1,1), (0,0), (0,0) ], [ (0,0), (1,1), (0,0) ], [ (0,0), (0,0), (1,1) ]], [[ (1,1), (0,0) ], [ (0,0), (1,1) ]], [[ (1,1) ]]\n</OUTPUT>",
