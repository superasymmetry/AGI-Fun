The payoffs are such that neither strategy is always better regardless of Player 2's choice.\n- For Player 2 (competitor firm), similarly, neither strategy strictly dominates the other. \n\nThis ensures that no strategy can be eliminated via iterated elimination of strictly dominated strategies. \n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (15, -30), (15, -10) ], [ (10, 0), (10, 10) ]]\n</OUTPUT>",
