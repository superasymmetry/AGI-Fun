    "inferences": "To change the given example so that it is not an instance of the game theory concept of Iterated Dominance, we need to ensure that there are no strictly dominated strategies in the game. A strictly dominated strategy is one that is never the best choice, regardless of what the other player chooses.\n\nThe original payoff matrix is:\nActions (A, A) leads to payoffs (4, 7)\nActions (A, B) leads to payoffs (0, 3)\nActions (B, A) leads to payoffs (2, 2)\nActions (B, B) leads to payoffs (1, 1)\n\nIn this matrix, strategy A is strictly dominated by strategy B for the computer, because regardless of the human's action, the computer gets a higher payoff by choosing B. Similarly, strategy B is not strictly dominated for the human, but strategy A is strictly dominated by strategy B when the computer chooses A, because the human gets a higher payoff by choosing B.\n\nTo eliminate iterated dominance, we need to modify the payoffs so that there are no strictly dominated strategies. Here's an example of how we could modify the payoffs:\n\nActions (A, A) leads to payoffs (4, 7)\nActions (A, B) leads to payoffs (3, 3)\nActions (B, A) leads to payoffs (2, 2)\nActions (B, B) leads to payoffs (1, 1)\n\nAlternatively, we could also modify the payoffs as follows:\n\nActions (A, A) leads to payoffs (4, 7)\nActions (A, B) leads to payoffs (0, 5)\nActions (B, A) leads to payoffs (5, 2)\nActions (B, B) leads to payoffs (1, 1)\n\nOr:\n\nActions (A, A) leads to payoffs (7, 4)\nActions (A, B) leads to payoffs (2, 2)\nActions (B, A) leads to payoffs (1, 1)\nActions (B, B) leads to payoffs (3, 3)\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (4,7), (3,3), (2,2) ], [ (2,2), (1,1), (1,1) ], [ (1,1), (1,1), (1,1) ]],\n[[ (4,7), (0,5), (5,2) ], [ (5,2), (1,1), (1,1) ], [ (1,1), (1,1), (1,1) ]],\n[[ (7,4), (2,2), (1,1) ], [ (1,1), (3,3), (1,1) ], [ (1,1), (1,1), (1,1) ]]",
