    "inferences": "To create an instance of the game theory concept of Iterated Dominance, we need to analyze the given payoff structure for the modified rock-paper-scissors game and adjust it to demonstrate the elimination of strictly dominated strategies.\n\nFirst, let's establish the initial payoff matrix based on the given rules:\n\n- When one person plays scissors and the other plays rock, then rock wins -10 points and scissors wins 0 points.\n- When one person plays scissors and the other plays paper, then paper wins 1 point and scissors wins 0 points.\n- When both players play scissors, then both players win 0 points.\n- When one person plays rock and the other plays paper, the person playing rock wins 3 points, and the person playing paper wins 2 points.\n- When we both play rock, we both win 1 point.\n- When we both play paper, we both win 1 point.\n\nLet's assign the strategies as follows: \n- Row 1: Player 1 plays Rock\n- Row 2: Player 1 plays Paper\n- Row 3: Player 1 plays Scissors\n- Column 1: Player 2 plays Rock\n- Column 2: Player 2 plays Paper\n- Column 3: Player 2 plays Scissors\n\nThe initial payoff matrix is:\n[[ (-10, 0), (3, 2), (1, 1) ],\n [ (2, 3), (1, 1), (0, 1) ],\n [ (0, -10), (0, 1), (0, 0) ]]\n\nTo demonstrate iterated dominance, we need to identify and eliminate strictly dominated strategies. \n\n1. **First Iteration**: \nLooking at the matrix, for Player 1, playing Scissors (Row 3) is strictly dominated by playing Rock (Row 1) because regardless of what Player 2 chooses, playing Rock yields better or equal payoffs compared to playing Scissors. Thus, we can eliminate the third row.\n\nThe matrix after the first iteration is:\n[[ (-10, 0), (3, 2), (1, 1) ],\n [ (2, 3), (1, 1), (0, 1) ]]\n\n2. **Second Iteration**:\nFor Player 2, playing Rock (Column 1) is strictly dominated by playing Paper (Column 2) because, given the reduced matrix, playing Paper yields better payoffs for Player 2 regardless of Player 1's choice. Thus, we can eliminate the first column.\n\nThe matrix after the second iteration is:\n[[ (3, 2), (1, 1) ],\n [ (0, 1), (1, 1) ]]\n\nAt this point, there are no more strictly dominated strategies for either player, as each strategy has a scenario where it yields a better payoff than another strategy, depending on the opponent's choice.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (-10, 0), (3, 2), (1, 1) ],\n [ (2, 3), (1, 1), (0, 1) ],\n [ (0, -10), (0, 1), (0, 0) ]],\n[[ (-10, 0), (3, 2), (1, 1) ],\n [ (2, 3), (1, 1), (0, 1) ]],\n[[ (3, 2), (1, 1) ],\n [ (0, 1), (1, 1) ]]",
