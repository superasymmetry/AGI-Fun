    "inferences": "To change the given example so it's not an instance of Iterated Dominance, we need to modify the scenario such that no strategy is strictly dominated by another. In the original scenario, the decision hinges on the wait times at two locations of the Life Alive cafe, with the wait time at the Central Square location depending on how many of the 200 customers choose to go there.\n\nThe original scenario implies a game where the player (you) decides which cafe to go to, and the other \"player\" could be considered as the collective decision of the 200 customers. However, this is not a traditional game theory setup because the 200 customers are not making a strategic decision in the context of game theory; they are simply preferring one option over another based on the lines at other restaurants.\n\nTo create a scenario that fits into a game theory framework and does not involve Iterated Dominance, we could consider a different setup where two players make strategic decisions, and each has multiple strategies with different payoffs.\n\nLet's consider a simplified example where two players, Player 1 (you) and Player 2 (another customer), are deciding whether to go to the Harvard Square cafe or the Central Square cafe. The payoffs could be based on the wait times and personal preferences.\n\nFor instance, let's say the payoffs for wait times are as follows: \n- If both go to Harvard Square, the wait is 10 minutes for both.\n- If both go to Central Square, the wait is 5 minutes for both because the other customers prefer the other restaurant in Central Square due to its shorter lines today.\n- If one goes to Harvard Square and the other to Central Square, the wait for the one in Harvard Square is 5 minutes, and for the one in Central Square, it's 10 minutes.\n\nThis setup doesn't directly reflect the original scenario but illustrates how to construct a game theory problem. The payoff matrix for this simplified game could look like this:\n\n[[ (10,10), (5,10) ],\n [ (10,5), (5,5) ]]\n\nHowever, to ensure this doesn't involve Iterated Dominance, we need to make sure no strategy is strictly better than another regardless of what the other player chooses. Let's modify the payoffs so that each player has a strategic decision to make without a strictly dominated strategy:\n\n[[ (10,10), (8,12) ],\n [ (12,8), (5,5) ]]\n\nIn this matrix, Player 1's strategies are the rows, and Player 2's strategies are the columns. The numbers in the parentheses represent the payoffs for Player 1 and Player 2, respectively.\n\nTo further ensure the game does not involve Iterated Dominance, let's create another matrix where the payoffs are structured such that no single strategy dominates another for either player:\n\n[[ (10,10), (12,8) ],\n [ (8,12), (9,9) ]]\n\nAnd another:\n\n[[ (10,10), (9,11) ],\n [ (11,9), (8,8) ]]\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (10,10), (8,12) ], [ (12,8), (5,5) ]], [[ (10,10), (12,8) ], [ (8,12), (9,9) ]], [[ (10,10), (9,11) ], [ (11,9), (8,8) ]]",
