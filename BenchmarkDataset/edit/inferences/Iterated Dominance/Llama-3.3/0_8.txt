    "inferences": "To change the given example so that it is not an instance of the Iterated Dominance game theory concept, we need to ensure that there are no strictly dominated strategies for either player. A strictly dominated strategy is one that is never the best choice for a player, regardless of what the other player chooses.\n\nLet's analyze the original example:\n\n- If both firms advertise, they both get $30 million.\n- If one firm advertises but the other does not, the advertising firm gets $50 million, and the non-advertising firm gets $0.\n- If both firms don't advertise, they both get $10 million.\n- Advertising costs $35 million for the first firm and $60 million for the competitor.\n\nThe payoffs for the first firm (Player 1) and the competitor (Player 2) can be represented as follows, considering the costs:\n\n- Both advertise: ($30M - $35M, $30M - $60M) = (-$5M, -$30M)\n- First firm advertises, competitor does not: ($50M - $35M, $50M - $0 is incorrect since the non-advertising firm gets $0, so) ($50M - $35M, $0) = ($15M, $0)\n- First firm does not advertise, competitor advertises: ($0, $50M - $60M) = ($50M - $0 is incorrect for the first firm since it gets $0, so) ($0, -$10M)\n- Neither advertises: ($10M, $10M)\n\nSo, the original payoff matrix is:\n[[ ($15M, $0), (-$5M, -$30M) ],\n [ ($0, -$10M), ($10M, $10M) ]]\n\nTo make this not an instance of Iterated Dominance, we need to adjust the payoffs so that no strategy is strictly dominated. Let's adjust the payoffs so that each strategy could potentially be the best choice depending on what the other player chooses.\n\nFor example, let's change the payoffs to:\n[[ (20, 0), (15, 10) ],\n [ (0, 5), (10, 20) ]]\n\nIn this adjusted matrix, there is no strictly dominated strategy for either player because the best choice for each player depends on the action of the other player.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (20, 0), (15, 10) ],\n [ (0, 5), (10, 20) ]]",
