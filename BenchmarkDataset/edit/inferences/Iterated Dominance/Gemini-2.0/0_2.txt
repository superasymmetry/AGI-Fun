    "inferences": "To make this scenario *not* an instance of iterated dominance, we need to remove the clear dominance relationship. Right now, going to Building 45 is a dominant strategy for you because your brother will *never* go to Building 52 unless you go there.\n\nHere's a modified scenario:\n\n**I'm trying to meet up with my brother in Cambridge, but his phone just died and I cannot reach him. We always meet up in either building 45 or building 52 at MIT, and I know he'll go to one of those buildings right now. He *prefers* building 45 but *really* wants to meet me, so if he thinks I'm likely to go to Building 52, he'll go there himself to ensure we meet.  As for me, I also want to meet my brother. I *slightly* prefer building 45, but mostly I just want to be in the same place as him. Which building should I go to in order to try and find my brother?**\n\n**Why this avoids iterated dominance:**\n\n*   **No longer a strictly dominant strategy:**  Your preference for Building 45 is weak.  Your brother's actions *depend* on what he thinks you're going to do. This removes the certainty that he will *never* go to Building 52 unless you go there.\n*   **Mutual Dependence:** The scenario now involves a degree of strategic thinking about what the *other* person is likely to do.  If you think your brother believes you're going to Building 52 (perhaps he thinks you know he prefers Building 45), he'll go there.  This makes the decision more nuanced than simple dominance.\n*   **Possibility of Multiple Equilibria:** This revised game might have multiple Nash equilibria (both of you go to Building 45, or both of you go to Building 52) and requires reasoning about expectations and beliefs.\n\nThe key is to remove the guarantee of your brother *never* going to Building 52 unless forced.  Introducing even a small chance that he'll go to Building 52 based on his beliefs about your actions makes the game much more complicated than iterated dominance.\n",
