You know he's currently at either MIT or Harvard. You also know:\n\n*   **You both want to meet, above all else.** This is the primary payoff.\n*   **First Layer:** Your brother *prefers* to go to Harvard.\n*   **Second Layer:** *If* your brother thinks you will go to MIT, then he will *instead* go to MIT.\n*   **Third Layer:** *If* your brother thinks you will *also* go to MIT, then he will *instead* go to Harvard.\n\n**Iterated Dominance Breakdown:**\n\n1.  **Your Brother's Initial Strategy:**\n\n    *   **Initial State:** Your brother *prefers* Harvard\n2.  **First Iteration (Your Perspective):**\n\n    *   You realize your brother *prefers* Harvard.\n    *   Given that preference, your best strategy is to go to Harvard.\n3.  **Second Iteration (Your Brother's Perspective):**\n\n    *   Your brother realizes you know his *initial* preference for Harvard.\n    *   He realizes that you will likely go to Harvard.\n    *   But if you think he will go to Harvard, then he will switch to MIT.\n4.  **Third Iteration (Your Perspective):**\n\n    *   You know that your brother knows you will go to Harvard.\n    *   You know that your brother wants to switch to MIT.\n    *   But if you think he will go to MIT, then he will switch to Harvard.\n\n**Outcome:**\n\nThe outcome of this process is that the iterated dominance of rational thought causes you to go to Harvard and for your brother to switch to Harvard.",
