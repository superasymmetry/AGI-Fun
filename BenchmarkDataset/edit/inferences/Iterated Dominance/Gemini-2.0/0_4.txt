    "inferences": "To make this game NOT solvable by iterated dominance, we need to ensure that no strategy is always worse than another, regardless of what the opponent does. Currently, the provided scoring makes certain strategies clearly dominant or dominated, leading to a solvable iterated dominance scenario.\n\nHere's a revised version that removes the dominance aspect, making iterated dominance inapplicable.  The changes are subtle but crucial:\n\n**Revised Rock-Paper-Scissors Scoring:**\n\n*   **Rock vs. Scissors:** Rock wins 5 points, Scissors loses 3 points.\n*   **Scissors vs. Paper:** Scissors wins 2 points, Paper loses 1 point.\n*   **Paper vs. Rock:** Paper wins 4 points, Rock loses 0 points.\n*   **Rock vs. Rock:** Both players win 1 point.\n*   **Scissors vs. Scissors:** Both players win 0 points.\n*   **Paper vs. Paper:** Both players win 3 points.\n\n**Why this revision removes Iterated Dominance:**\n\nIn the original game, it was likely that scissors was *dominated* by another strategy (or perhaps rock was *dominant*).  Meaning that no matter what your opponent did, you would have always scored more (or less) by playing one of the other options. \n\n*   **No clear dominance:** In the revised scoring, no strategy always guarantees a better outcome than another, *regardless* of what your friend plays.\n\n    *   If your friend always plays Rock, Paper is a good response.\n    *   If your friend always plays Paper, Scissors is a good response.\n    *   If your friend always plays Scissors, Rock is a good response.\n\n*   **Mixed Strategies become relevant:** Because there is no single \"best\" option that always trumps others, you are forced to consider the probabilities with which your friend chooses each strategy and adjust your own strategy to suit that probability.\n\n**In short:** The revised scoring introduces sufficient variability in the outcomes, preventing any strategy from being consistently superior or inferior, thus removing the possibility of solving the game through iterated dominance. You would need to use a different technique, such as finding a Nash Equilibrium in mixed strategies, to analyze this revised game.\n\n",
