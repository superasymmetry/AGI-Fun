    "inferences": "To make this example *not* an instance of iterated dominance, we need to ensure that there isn't a strategy that's clearly worse than another, *regardless* of what the other player does. Right now, advertising is the dominant strategy for your firm.  We need to change the numbers so that *neither* firm has a dominant strategy. Here's a modified scenario:\n\nMy firm and a competitor firm are deciding whether or not we want to advertise for the cereal we\u2019re selling.\n\n*   **If both firms advertise**, we both get $30 million dollars in sales.\n*   **If my firm advertises but the competitor does not**, then my firm gets $50 million in sales, and the competitor gets $10 million in sales.\n*   **If the competitor firm advertises but my firm does not**, then the competitor gets $50 million in sales, and my firm gets $10 million in sales.\n*   **If both firms don\u2019t advertise**, then both firms get $35 million dollars in sales.\n*   For both firms, cereal costs no money to produce.\n*   **For my firm, advertising costs $35 million.**\n*   **For the competitor firm, advertising costs $30 million.**\n\nLet's create payoff matrices to analyze this:\n\n**My Firm**\n\n|          | Competitor Advertises | Competitor Doesn't Advertise |\n| -------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------- |\n| Advertise | 30 - 35 = -5            | 50 - 35 = 15               |\n| Don't Advertise| 10                    | 35                         |\n\n**Competitor Firm**\n\n|          | My Firm Advertises | My Firm Doesn't Advertise |\n| -------- | ------------------- | -------------------------- |\n| Advertise | 30 - 30 = 0         | 50 - 30 = 20               |\n| Don't Advertise| 10                 | 35                         |\n\nNow, let's analyze:\n\n*   **My Firm:**\n    *   If the competitor advertises, my best strategy is *not* to advertise (10 > -5).\n    *   If the competitor *doesn't* advertise, my best strategy is to advertise (15 > 35).\n    *   Therefore, *my firm does not have a dominant strategy*.\n\n*   **Competitor Firm:**\n    *   If my firm advertises, the competitor's best strategy is *not* to advertise (10 > 0).\n    *   If my firm *doesn't* advertise, the competitor's best strategy is to advertise (20 > 35).\n    *   Therefore, *the competitor firm does not have a dominant strategy*.\n\nWith these changed values, *neither* firm has a dominant strategy.  Because there are no dominant strategies, iterated dominance cannot be applied.  You can't eliminate any strategies based on them being strictly worse than other options. This scenario now requires more sophisticated game-theoretic analysis, such as finding Nash equilibria.",
