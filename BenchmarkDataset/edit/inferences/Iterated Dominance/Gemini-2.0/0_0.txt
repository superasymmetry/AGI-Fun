    "inferences": "To make this scenario NOT an instance of iterated dominance, we need to introduce a element that prevents eliminating strategies based on simple dominance at each stage. Here's one way to do it:\n\n**Modified Scenario:**\n\nI'm trying to decide whether to have dinner at the Life Alive cafe in Harvard Square, or the Life Alive cafe in Central Square. Both have the same menu. My primary consideration is the wait time, but I *also* value the ambiance and surroundings. Harvard Square has a general ambiance and energy that I value at the equivalent of *subtracting* 2 minutes from my perceived wait time.\n\nI know from experience that there's always a 5 minute wait in the Harvard Square cafe.  This means my *effective* wait is 5 - 2 = 3 minutes.\n\nIn the Central Square cafe, there\u2019s a set of 200 customers who always go to some restaurant in Central square (either Life Alive or another restaurant). The wait for me in Life Alive Central Square will be x/20 minutes if x customers go there. I also know that today, other restaurants in central square have incredibly long lines, so those 200 customers strictly prefer going to the Life Alive in Central Square over other restaurants.\n\n**Why this avoids Iterated Dominance:**\n\n1.  **No strictly dominated strategy at the outset**:  Because of the ambiance, Harvard Square is no longer *strictly* dominated by Central Square.  Even if I *knew* only a few people would go to the Central Square location (say, 1 person), resulting in a wait of 1/20 of a minute, I might still prefer Harvard Square with its effective wait of 3 minutes due to the ambiance.\n\n2. **No single action that is strictly worse than another**: Without the ambiance offset, Central Square would always be the superior option because no matter how long the wait time would be, it would be less than 5 minutes in Harvard Square. Now, there is a trade-off.\n\n**In essence, by adding a non-quantifiable element (ambiance) that affects the perceived payoff of one of the strategies, we make it impossible to eliminate that strategy based solely on wait time considerations.** This breaks the chain of iterated elimination of dominated strategies.  The best choice now depends on a subjective valuation of ambiance versus wait time, making it a more complex decision that goes beyond simple dominance.\n",
