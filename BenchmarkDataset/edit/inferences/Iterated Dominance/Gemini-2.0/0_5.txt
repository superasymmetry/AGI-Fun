    "inferences": "Okay, here's a modified version of the rock-paper-scissors game that allows for iterated dominance to be applied, and the reasoning for why this leads to a predictable outcome.  I'll break down the steps clearly.\n\n**Modified Rock-Paper-Scissors Game (Iterated Dominance Example)**\n\nI'm playing a modified Rock-Paper-Scissors game with my friend Eric. The scoring works like this:\n\n*   **Rock vs. Scissors:** Rock wins 1 point, Scissors loses 1 point.\n*   **Scissors vs. Paper:** Scissors wins 1 point, Paper loses 1 point.\n*   **Paper vs. Rock:** Paper wins 1 point, Rock loses 1 point.\n*   **Rock vs. Rock:** Both win 0 points.\n*   **Scissors vs. Scissors:** Both win 0 points.\n*   **Paper vs. Paper:** Both win 0 points.\n*   **However, If you play rock you pay a tax of 2 points.**\n*   **If you play paper you pay a tax of 1 point.**\n*   **There is no tax for playing scissors**\n\n**Analysis using Iterated Dominance:**\n\n**Step 1: Player's Payoff Matrix:**\n\nLet's represent the payoffs for *you* (the player) in a matrix, assuming Eric is your opponent:\n\n|          | Eric: Rock | Eric: Paper | Eric: Scissors |\n| -------- | ---------- | ----------- | ------------- |\n| **You: Rock**    | -2        | -3         | -1           |\n| **You: Paper**   | 0         | -1        | 2           |\n| **You: Scissors** | 1         | -1          | 0            |\n\n*Explanation of the matrix numbers.*\n\nLets look at the first entry: Eric plays rock and you play rock. You would win 0 points based on the normal rules, however, you must subtract the 2 points for playing rock giving -2 points.\nNow lets look at the last entry: Eric plays scissors and you play scissors. You would win 0 points based on the normal rules and pay no tax for playing scissors.\n\n**Step 2: First Round of Dominance**\n\nLook at the payoff matrix from your perspective.\n\nFor every column in the payoff matrix, scissors has an equal or higher score than rock.\n\n**Therefore, Rock is strictly dominated by scissors. You should never play Rock.**\n\nWe can remove rock from the matrix, because there is no reason to ever play it.\n\n|          | Eric: Rock | Eric: Paper | Eric: Scissors |\n| -------- | ---------- | ----------- | ------------- |\n| **You: Paper**   | 0         | -1        | 2           |\n| **You: Scissors** | 1         | -1          | 0            |\n\n**Step 3: Second Round of Dominance**\n\nEric now knows that you should never play rock. Therefore, Eric should also never play rock.\n\nThe payoffs become:\n\n|          | Eric: Paper | Eric: Scissors |\n| -------- | ----------- | ------------- |\n| **You: Paper**   | -1        | 2           |\n| **You: Scissors** | -1          | 0            |\n\n**Step 4: Final Round of Dominance**\n\nFor every column in the payoff matrix, paper has an equal or higher score than scissors.\n\n**Therefore, Scissors is strictly dominated by paper. You should never play Scissors.**\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBy Iterated Dominance, you should always play Paper.\n",
