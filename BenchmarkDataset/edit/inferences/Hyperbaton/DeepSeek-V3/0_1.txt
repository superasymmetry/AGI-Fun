    "label": "yes",
    "inferences": "To avoid creating an instance of hyperbaton (which involves an unusual or inverted word order), the blank should be filled in a way that maintains a standard, straightforward sentence structure. Here's a suitable replacement for the blank:\n\n\"Ever onward, I trust myself into a brand new life.\"\n\nThis keeps the sentence in a natural, non-inverted order, avoiding hyperbaton. The original structure (\"Ever _, I trust myself...\") could lend itself to hyperbaton if filled with a phrase that disrupts the typical subject-verb-object order, but \"onward\" maintains a standard adverb placement. \n\nOther possible non-hyperbaton options could include:\n- \"Ever forward, I trust myself into a brand new life.\"\n- \"Ever since, I trust myself into a brand new life.\"\n\nThese all keep the sentence structure conventional. The key is to avoid rearrangements like \"Ever do I trust myself...\" or \"Ever myself I trust...,\" which would be hyperbaton."
