    "inferences": "To change the given example so that it is not an instance of the Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium, we need to adjust the payoffs so that there is a dominant strategy for at least one player. \n\nLet's analyze the given example:\n- If Manu wants to hike and Tom goes for the beach day, it rains and neither has fun (-1 point to each).\n- If Manu wants to hike and Tom wants to play board games, Manu feels like Tom is boring (-10 points to Manu) and Tom has a very boring day (+0 points).\n- If Manu wants to have a movie night and Tom wants to go to the beach, Manu's movie falls flat (+0 points to her) and Tom drowns (-10 points to Tom).\n- If Manu wants to have a movie night and Tom wants to play board games, they are surrounded by fluorescent light for too long (-5 points to each).\n\nThe given situation where Manu chooses to do a movie night and Tom chooses a board game is not a Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium because, in a Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium, no player can improve their payoff by unilaterally changing their strategy, assuming the other player keeps their strategy unchanged.\n\nHowever, the provided payoffs do not directly fit into a standard payoff matrix without assigning numerical values to the outcomes. Let's assign numerical values based on the descriptions given, but we will adjust them to ensure the scenario does not represent a Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium. For simplicity, let's assume the payoffs are as follows, but we will adjust them:\n\nOriginal Payoff Matrix:\n- Hike & Beach Day: (-1, -1)\n- Hike & Board Games: (-10, 0)\n- Movie Night & Beach Day: (0, -10)\n- Movie Night & Board Games: (-5, -5)\n\nAdjusted to not be a Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium, let's make \"Movie Night\" a dominant strategy for Manu by making its payoffs better than \"Hike\" regardless of Tom's choice. Also, let's make \"Board Games\" a dominant strategy for Tom by making its payoffs better than \"Beach Day\" regardless of Manu's choice.\n\nAdjusted Payoff Matrix:\n- Hike & Beach Day: (-1, -1)\n- Hike & Board Games: (-10, 10)  # Tom prefers Board Games\n- Movie Night & Beach Day: (10, -10)  # Manu prefers Movie Night\n- Movie Night & Board Games: (10, 10)  # Both prefer this outcome\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (-1, -1), (-10, 10) ],\n [ (10, -10), (10, 10) ]]",
