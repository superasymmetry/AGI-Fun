    "inferences": "To change the given example so that it's not an instance of the Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium, we need to adjust the payoffs so that there's a dominant strategy for at least one player. \n\nIn the original setup:\n- An uptempo and lyrical song would thrill Martha (+1 point) but disappoint Paul (-1 point).\n- A downbeat and lyrical song would disappoint Martha (-1 point) but thrill Paul (+1 point).\n- An uptempo but rhythmic song would disappoint Martha (-1 point) but thrill Paul (+1 point).\n- A downbeat and rhythmic song would thrill Martha (+1 point), but disappoint Paul (-1 point).\n\nLet's modify the payoffs so that Martha always prefers an uptempo song, regardless of Paul's choice, and Paul always prefers a lyrical song, regardless of Martha's choice. This would make \"uptempo\" a dominant strategy for Martha and \"lyrical\" a dominant strategy for Paul, thus avoiding a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium.\n\nThe modified payoffs could be:\n- An uptempo and lyrical song would give Martha (+2 points) and Paul (+1 point).\n- A downbeat and lyrical song would give Martha (-1 point) and Paul (+2 points).\n- An uptempo but rhythmic song would give Martha (+2 points) and Paul (-1 point).\n- A downbeat and rhythmic song would give Martha (-1 point) and Paul (-1 point).\n\nHowever, to strictly follow the format requested and to ensure the payoffs are non-negative and integer-valued, we adjust the payoffs as follows:\n- An uptempo and lyrical song would give Martha (2 points) and Paul (1 point).\n- A downbeat and lyrical song would give Martha (0 points) and Paul (2 points).\n- An uptempo but rhythmic song would give Martha (2 points) and Paul (0 points).\n- A downbeat and rhythmic song would give Martha (0 points) and Paul (0 points).\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (2,1), (2,0) ],\n [ (0,2), (0,0) ]]",
