    "inferences": "To change the given example so that it's not an instance of the Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium, we need to alter the payoff matrix in a way that no mixed strategy profile can be a Nash equilibrium. \n\nGiven the conditions:\n- If either player chooses the same action, neither is excited (+0 points to each).\n- If Fred wants pepperoni but Neville wants mushrooms: -1pt to Fred, +1pt to Neville.\n- If Fred wants pepperoni but Neville wants pineapple: +1pt to Fred, -1pt to Neville.\n- If Fred wants mushrooms but Neville wants pepperoni: +1pt to Fred, -1pt to Neville.\n- If Fred wants mushrooms but Neville wants pineapple: -1pt to Fred, +1pt to Neville.\n- If Fred wants pineapple but Neville wants pepperoni: -1pt to Fred, +1pt to Neville.\n- If Fred wants pineapple but Neville wants mushrooms: +1pt to Fred, -1pt to Neville.\n\nThe original payoff matrix for Fred (Player 1) and Neville (Player 2) can be represented as follows, with the rows representing Fred's actions (Pepperoni, Mushrooms, Pineapple) and the columns representing Neville's actions (Pepperoni, Mushrooms, Pineapple):\n\n[[ (0,0), (-1,1), (1,-1) ],\n [ (1,-1), (0,0), (-1,1) ],\n [ (-1,1), (1,-1), (0,0) ]]\n\nTo ensure this is not a Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium, we need to modify the payoffs so that there's a clear dominant strategy for at least one player, or the payoffs are such that no mixed strategy can be an equilibrium. \n\nHowever, the provided setup inherently suggests a situation where mixed strategies could be considered due to the nature of the payoffs. To alter this and ensure no mixed strategy equilibrium exists, we could consider a scenario where one player has a strictly dominant strategy, making mixed strategies unnecessary for them.\n\nLet's modify the payoffs to create a dominant strategy for one of the players. For instance, if we make \"Mushrooms\" a dominant strategy for Fred regardless of Neville's choice, we could adjust the payoffs as follows:\n\n[[ (0,0), (-1,1), (1,-1) ],\n [ (2,-1), (2,0), (2,-1) ],\n [ (-1,1), (1,-1), (0,0) ]]\n\nIn this modified version, Fred gets a higher payoff for choosing \"Mushrooms\" regardless of Neville's action, making \"Mushrooms\" a dominant strategy for Fred. This change means Fred will always choose \"Mushrooms,\" eliminating the need for a mixed strategy for Fred.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (0,0), (-1,1), (1,-1) ],\n [ (2,-1), (2,0), (2,-1) ],\n [ (-1,1), (1,-1), (0,0) ]]",
