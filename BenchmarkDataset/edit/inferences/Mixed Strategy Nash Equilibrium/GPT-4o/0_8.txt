    "inferences": "To change the example so that it no longer represents an instance of a Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium, we need to adjust the payoffs of the strategies such that one or both players have a dominant strategy, or the strategies do not involve probabilistic decisions for equilibrium. This results in a scenario with no incentive for either player to adjust their strategy based on the other player\u2019s choice, thereby eliminating any mixed strategies.\n\nLet's adjust the payoff structure so that each player has a dominant strategy:\n\nRevised Payoffs:\n- If Manu goes Hiking and Tom chooses Beach Day: (2,2)\n- If Manu goes Hiking and Tom chooses Board Games: (6,5)\n- If Manu chooses Movie Night and Tom chooses Beach Day: (1,4)\n- If Manu chooses Movie Night and Tom chooses Board Games: (3,3)\n\nNow, let's create the payoff matrix under these new conditions. The goal is to ensure that at least one strategy pair becomes strictly better than any mixed strategy.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (2,2), (6,5) ],\n [ (1,4), (3,3) ]]\n<OUTPUT>",
