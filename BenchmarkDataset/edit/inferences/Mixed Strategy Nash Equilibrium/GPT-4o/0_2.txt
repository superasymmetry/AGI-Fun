    "inferences": "To change the example so that it does not exhibit a Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium, we need to create a situation where one of the players always has a dominant strategy or where the payoffs are such that mixed strategies are not beneficial to either player. \n\nFirst, let's consider altering the player preferences so that one strategy strictly dominates the other for one of the players. For instance, we could adjust the payoffs such that whenever Paul chooses Rhythmic, regardless of Martha's choice, he receives a higher payoff compared to choosing Lyrical. Similarly, Martha's payoffs could be adjusted so that one of her strategies consistently yields a better outcome compared to the other.\n\nLet's change the payoff matrix to reflect this:\n\nOriginal Matrix:\n- Uptempo & Lyrical: (1, -1)\n- Downbeat & Lyrical: (-1, 1)\n- Uptempo & Rhythmic: (-1, 1)\n- Downbeat & Rhythmic: (1, -1)\n\nAltered Matrix:\n- Uptempo & Lyrical: (2, 0)\n- Downbeat & Lyrical: (0, 1)\n- Uptempo & Rhythmic: (1, 2)\n- Downbeat & Rhythmic: (1, 1)\n\nIn the altered game: \n\n- If Martha chooses Uptempo, Paul prefers Rhythmic for a payoff of (1, 2) instead of Lyrical (2, 0).\n- If Martha chooses Downbeat, Paul again prefers Rhythmic for the payoff of (1, 1) compared to Lyrical (0, 1).\n\nHere, Paul has a dominant strategy: always choose Rhythmic, thus eliminating the Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium for this setting.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (2, 0), (0, 1) ],\n [ (1, 2), (1, 1) ]]\n",
