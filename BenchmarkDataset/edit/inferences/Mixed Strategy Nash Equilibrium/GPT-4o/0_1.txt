    "inferences": "To transform the game into one with a Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium, the payoffs must be adjusted so that the players are indifferent between their strategies when their opponent uses a mixed strategy. This typically occurs when each player's strategy is the best response to the other's mixed strategy, and neither player can improve their payoff by unilaterally changing their strategy.\n\nWe modify the payoffs of Joe and Ben so that each has an incentive to randomize their strategies.\n\nConsider the changed payoffs:\n\n- If Joe chooses Utility Gear (U) and Ben chooses Lightweight Items (L), the original payoffs remain: (1, 0).\n- If Joe chooses Utility Gear (U) and Ben chooses Rugged Items (R), we'll introduce some payoff, say, (0, 1) to Ben.\n- If Joe chooses Durable Gear (D) and Ben chooses Lightweight Items (L), we'll introduce some payoff, say, (2, 1) to both.\n- If Joe chooses Durable Gear (D) and Ben chooses Rugged Items (R), we'll introduce some payoff, say, (2, 2) to both.\n\nWith these payoffs, Joe and Ben would be indifferent between each of their strategies if the probabilities are chosen appropriately.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[(1, 0), (0, 1)],\n [(2, 1), (2, 2)]]\n",
