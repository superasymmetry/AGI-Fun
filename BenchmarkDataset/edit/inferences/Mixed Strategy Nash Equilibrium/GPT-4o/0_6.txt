If Kevin chooses chips and Claire chooses chocolate, both get slight satisfaction: Kevin gets +1, Claire gets +1.\n2. If Kevin chooses chips and Claire chooses candy, both gain: Kevin gets +2, Claire gets +3.\n3. If Kevin chooses popcorn and Claire chooses chocolate, both are quite happy: Kevin gets +3, Claire gets +2.\n4. If Kevin chooses popcorn and Claire chooses candy, both enjoy it greatly: Kevin gets +4, Claire gets +4.\n\nNew payoff matrix formulation:\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (1,1), (2,3) ],\n [ (3,2), (4,4) ]]\n<OUTPUT>",
