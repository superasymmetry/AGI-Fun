    "inferences": "To ensure this game doesn't have a Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium, we can adjust the payoffs such that each player has a dominant strategy. This means that regardless of what the other player chooses, one strategy will always give a higher payoff to a player. Let's assume that choosing \"Pepperoni\" becomes a dominant strategy for Fred and \"Pineapple\" does the same for Neville by modifying the payoffs.  \n\n Modified Payoff Structure: \n- If both choose the same topping, it's a draw (0, 0). \n- If Fred chooses Pepperoni and Neville chooses Mushrooms or Pineapple, Fred always gains a higher payoff than any other strategy Neville could choose, say (2, -1) and (2, -1). \n- Similarly, if Neville chooses Pineapple and Fred chooses either Mushrooms or Pepperoni, Neville always gains a higher payoff, say (-1, 2) and (-1, 2). \n- We should also alter conditions where both Fred and Neville choose non-dominant strategies against each other's dominant ones to have lesser payoffs compared to when they use their dominant strategies.\n\nLet's assign specific integer values to illustrate:\n\n- If Fred and Neville both choose Pepperoni: (0, 0)\n- If Fred and Neville both choose Mushrooms: (0, 0)\n- If Fred and Neville both choose Pineapple: (0, 0)\n- If Neville chooses Mushrooms and Fred chooses Pepperoni: (2, -1)\n- If Neville chooses Pineapple and Fred chooses Pepperoni: (2, -1)\n- If Fred chooses Mushrooms and Neville chooses Pineapple: (-1, 2)\n- If Fred chooses Pepperoni and Neville chooses Pineapple: (-1, 2)\n- If Fred chooses Mushrooms and Neville chooses Pepperoni: (-1, 2)\n- If Fred chooses Pineapple and Neville chooses Mushrooms: (1, -1)\n\nThese changes ensure that the dominant strategy removes the presence of a Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium. \n\n<OUTPUT>\n\n[[ (0,0), (2,-1), (1,-1) ],\n [ (-1,2), (0,0), (1,-1) ],\n [ (-1,2), (-1,2), (0,0) ]]\n\n",
