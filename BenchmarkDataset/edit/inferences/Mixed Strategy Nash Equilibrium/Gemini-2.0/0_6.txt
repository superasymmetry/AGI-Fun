    "inferences": "Okay, let's modify the payoffs in the snack selection game to ensure that the described mixed strategy *cannot* be a Nash equilibrium. To do this, we need to make it so that *at least one* of the players would always prefer a pure strategy (choosing one strategy with certainty) given the other player's mixed strategy.\n\nHere's the modified payoff matrix, followed by an explanation:\n\n**Modified Payoff Matrix**\n\n|             | Claire: Chocolate | Claire: Candy |\n|-------------|--------------------|-----------------|\n| Kevin: Chips |  (-1, -1)         |  (-10, -1)       |\n| Kevin: Popcorn| (0, -10)         |  (5, -10)        |\n\n**What's Changed and Why**\n\n*   **Kevin prefers Popcorn, No Matter What:** The critical change is that I've increased Kevin's payoff when he chooses popcorn and Claire chooses Candy from -5 to 5.\n\n**Explanation of why the previous mixed strategy is not a Nash Equilibrium in the modified game:**\n\nPreviously, we were trying to see if Kevin would prefer to choose either chips or popcorn given the mixed strategy (1/3 Chocolate, 1/3 Candy). Now, let's see what happens when Kevin chooses popcorn every time:\n\n*   If Kevin *always* chooses popcorn:\n    *   Claire's expected payoff from Chocolate: (1)(-10) = -10\n    *   Claire's expected payoff from Candy: (1)(-10) = -10\n    \n*   **Since these two are equal, this means that neither of them are always a better choice (dominant strategy).**\n\n*   **Since neither of these is a dominant strategy, let's see what happens when Claire randomizes between her options (1/3 for each option):**\n    *   Kevin's expected payoff from Chips: (1/3)(-1) + (1/3)(-10) = -11/3 = -3.67\n    *   Kevin's expected payoff from Popcorn: (1/3)(0) + (1/3)(5) = 5/3 = 1.67\n    \n*   **From here, we can see that Kevin would rather choose Popcorn every time in order to get a higher payoff. This means that Kevin will prefer to choose Popcorn instead of Chips when Claire uses her mixed strategy.**\n\n**In order for a strategy to be considered a Nash Equilibrium, there needs to be no incentive for anyone to deviate from it. Since there is an incentive for Kevin to choose Popcorn over Chips, this means that the previous mixed strategy is no longer a Nash Equilibrium.**\n\n**Key Idea:**\n\nA mixed strategy Nash equilibrium requires that each player is indifferent between all the strategies they mix over, *given* the other player's mixed strategy. We've made it so Kevin *prefers* popcorn, eliminating that indifference.",
