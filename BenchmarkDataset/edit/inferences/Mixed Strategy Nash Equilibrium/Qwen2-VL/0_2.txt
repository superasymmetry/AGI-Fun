    "inferences": "To make the example not an instance of a Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium, we need to change the payoffs such that there is no mixed strategy that is a Nash equilibrium. One way to do this is to make the payoffs for one of the players consistently higher for one of the strategies, regardless of the other player's choice. For example, we could change the payoffs for Martha such that she always prefers an uptempo song, regardless of whether it is lyrical or rhythmic. This would create a dominant strategy for Martha, and the game would no longer have a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium.\nHere is an example of a payoff matrix that meets these conditions:\n[[ (2, -1), (1, 0) ],\n [ (2, -1), (1, 0) ]]\nIn this matrix, Martha always gets a payoff of 2 for an uptempo song, regardless of whether it is lyrical or rhythmic. Paul gets a payoff of -1 for an uptempo song and 0 for a downbeat song, regardless of whether it is lyrical or rhythmic. This creates a dominant strategy for Martha (always choose uptempo) and eliminates the possibility of a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium.\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (2, -1), (1, 0) ],\n [ (2, -1), (1, 0) ]]",
