For Tom, both Beach Day and Board Games must yield equal expected payoffs (otherwise he wouldn't mix)\n2. For Manu, Movie Night must yield better payoff than Hiking given Tom's strategy\n\nLet me adjust the payoffs:\n\nFor Hiking:\n- (Hiking, Beach) = (-1,-1)\n- (Hiking, Board Games) = (2,4)\n\nFor Movie Night:\n- (Movie, Beach) = (3,3)\n- (Movie, Board Games) = (3,3)\n\nWith these payoffs:\n1. When Tom calculates expected payoff:\n   - Beach: 3 points\n   - Board Games: 3 points\n   So he's indifferent between the two, making mixing rational\n\n2. When Manu faces Tom's mixed strategy:\n   - Movie Night gives her consistent 3 points\n   - Hiking would give her: (-1)(1/3) + (2)(2/3) = 1 point\n   So she prefers Movie Night\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (-1,-1), (2,4) ],\n [ (3,3), (3,3) ]]",
