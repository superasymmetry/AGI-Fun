To do this, I'll adjust the payoffs to create a game with a pure strategy Nash equilibrium that's clearly dominant.\n\nIn game theory, a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium occurs when players randomize between different strategies because no pure strategy is strictly better than the others. To eliminate this, I'll create clear, preferred choices for both players.\n\nLet's modify the payoffs to make Movie Night clearly better for Manu and Board Games clearly better for Tom in all cases:\n\nFor hiking/beach: Let's change (-1,-1) to (0,0)\nFor hiking/board games: Change (-10,0) to (0,5)\nFor movie/beach: Change (0,-10) to (8,0)\nFor movie/board games: Change (-5,-5) to (10,10)\n\nThis creates a scenario where:\n- Movie Night is always better for Manu than Hiking\n- Board Games is always better for Tom than Beach Day\n- When both choose Movie Night/Board Games, they get the best outcome\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (0,0), (0,5) ],\n [ (8,0), (10,10) ]]",
