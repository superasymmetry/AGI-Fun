I'll modify the payoffs to ensure there's no pure strategy Nash Equilibrium, making a mixed strategy optimal.\n\nLet's analyze this:\n\n1) First, to create an MSNE situation, we need to make it so that no pure strategy dominates - both players should want to mix their strategies.\n\n2) For a 2x2 game, when players are using mixed strategies, they should be indifferent between their pure strategies when the other player is playing their equilibrium mixed strategy.\n\n3) Let's modify the payoffs while keeping the theme:\n\nFor Martha (row player) and Paul (column player):\n- Uptempo/Lyrical: Martha gets more benefit (3,1)\n- Downbeat/Lyrical: Benefits Paul more (1,3)\n- Uptempo/Rhythmic: Benefits Paul more (1,3)\n- Downbeat/Rhythmic: Benefits Martha more (3,1)\n\nThis creates a situation where:\n- Neither player has a dominant strategy\n- Each player wants to mix their strategies\n- The game becomes similar to a \"matching pennies\" variant\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (3,1), (1,3) ],\n [ (1,3), (3,1) ]]",
