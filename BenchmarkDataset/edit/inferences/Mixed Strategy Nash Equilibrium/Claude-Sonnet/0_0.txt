    "inferences": "Let me help modify this game to eliminate the Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium (MSNE).\n\nCurrently, the game has payoffs that are all equal (zero), which leads to the MSNE you described where each player chooses each strategy with 1/2 probability. This occurs because players are completely indifferent between their choices.\n\nTo eliminate the MSNE, we need to create clear preferences that lead to a pure strategy Nash Equilibrium instead. We can do this by making one combination clearly better for both players.\n\nLet's modify the payoffs so that both roommates actually prefer the Urban-Lush combination over all others. This creates a focal point where:\n- Urban-Lush gives both players positive utility (say 5,5)\n- All other combinations give zero utility (0,0)\n\nThis change means:\n1. The game will have a pure strategy Nash Equilibrium at (Urban, Lush)\n2. There won't be a MSNE because players have no incentive to randomize their strategies\n3. Both players will prefer to coordinate on the (Urban, Lush) outcome\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (5,5), (0,0) ],\n [ (0,0), (0,0) ]]",
