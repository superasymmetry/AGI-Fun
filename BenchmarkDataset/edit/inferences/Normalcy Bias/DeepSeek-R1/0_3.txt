It was perfect, a completely perfect dinner. I paid the $60 check and we went out to the parking lot to the car. I live in a huge college town along with that Saturday night being a senior ball so the town was busy.\n\nWe get back to the car and the cars surrounding it was parked exactly the same as they were when we went in. There were cars to each side of his car along with a truck parallel parked behind him at least two car lengths away. In front of him was the wall of the restaurant and behind him was the roadway in the parking lot then the parallel parked truck at a distance to clarify.\n\nHe starts to back out of the space and after a few tries he says he can\u2019t do it. I say instantly I can spot him so he can get out. He says no and that it won\u2019t help him because the truck behind him wasn\u2019t there when he pulled into the spot and he was scared of hitting it. (It was there when he pulled into the spot.) He also added he doesn\u2019t want others to see me spotting him like he can\u2019t handle his vehicle. I say okay, I\u2019ll go into the restaurant and find the owner of one of the car and ask if there was any way they would move so he could get out, didn\u2019t want to but it was the only choice. He says no and kinda flips his shit (throwing his hat and sunglasses into the dash in frustration and also flooring it as if he\u2019s going to hit the building then slamming on the break before he does so.) He calls his parents screaming about not being able to get out of the spot and even locked my door when I tried to get out of the vehicle to go get someone else to help/spot him.\n\nAlso when he is on the phone the owner of one of the neighboring cars comes outside. I try to tell him that we talk to her but he ignored me and kept complaining to his parents how there was no way we were getting out of the spot. The owner of the neighboring car gets in another car and leaves while my boyfriend gets off the phone and says: \u201cguess we\u2019re stuck.\u201d\n\nThe screaming and me begging him to just let me spot him continues for 20 minutes and he makes a few jabs that I don\u2019t have a license so I wouldn\u2019t understand how he feels. At that point I was really upset and in tears. I had just taken him out to dinner and spent a pretty good amount of money for him to show his ass? Finally he lets me out of the car to spot him and within 2 minutes we are out of the spot.\n\nLater that night I told him that he ruined the night and the dinner I paid for for absolutely no reason. I also added that he always has to find away to destroy any date or thing in general I want to do just because it\u2019s not something he picks. He said that what happened was my fault because I should\u2019ve have not spoken to him because it made him more frustrated when he was trying to find a \u201csolution to the problem.\u201d AITA here?",
    "prompt": "What is one line of dialogue that the writer could have included in their original blog post to make it obvious that the concept Normalcy Bias is present in the following text?

    "inferences": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to find a line of dialogue that would make it obvious that Normalcy Bias is present in the given text. Let me start by understanding what Normalcy Bias is. From what I remember, Normalcy Bias is a cognitive bias where people underestimate the possibility of a disaster or its effects, assuming things will function as they normally do even in the face of clear evidence to the contrary. People might refuse to acknowledge the reality of a situation because they can't believe it's happening.\n\nNow, looking at the scenario described. The boyfriend is in a parking spot, convinced he can't get out because he thinks the truck behind him wasn't there when he arrived. The girlfriend knows the truck was there all along, but he's refusing her help, getting frustrated, and even after the neighboring car leaves, he still thinks they're stuck. His behavior seems irrational because he's stuck in his belief despite evidence that the situation hasn't changed (the truck was there when he parked, so the space is the same as when he arrived). His refusal to accept help or reality might be an example of Normalcy Bias, but maybe he's stuck in the idea that the situation is impossible, not because he thinks everything is normal, but because he can't process the change. Wait, maybe I need to rethink that.\n\nWait, Normalcy Bias is more about assuming that things will continue as normal despite signs that something is wrong. In this case, the boyfriend might be refusing to accept that the parking situation is manageable because he's stuck in the belief that it's impossible, maybe because he can't process that the truck was there all along. So he's underestimating the possibility that he can get out, perhaps because he's in a panic and can't think clearly, defaulting to the idea that they're stuck. So a line that shows he's dismissing the reality (that the truck was there when he arrived) and insisting that the situation is impossible, thus demonstrating Normalcy Bias.\n\nThe girlfriend mentions that the truck was there when he pulled in, but he insists it wasn't. Maybe a line where he denies the reality, like \"That truck wasn't there before, there's no way I can get out now!\" But wait, the original text already has him saying that the truck wasn't there when he pulled in. So maybe adding a line where he insists that the situation is impossible despite evidence, like \"This can't be happening, the truck wasn't there before and now we're stuck!\" But the user wants a line that the writer could have included to make it obvious that Normalcy Bias is present. So perhaps a line where he dismisses the possibility of getting out because he can't accept that the situation is manageable, even though the environment hasn't changed. Maybe something like, \"There's no way this is possible, everything was fine when we got here!\" which shows he's stuck in the belief that since things were normal before, they can't have changed, even though they haven't. Wait, but the problem is that the truck was there all along, so the situation hasn't changed. So his belief that it's different now is a misperception. So a line that shows he's denying the current reality because he's anchored in the initial normal state. Maybe he says, \"This doesn't make sense, it was all clear when we parked!\" even though it wasn't. That would highlight his refusal to accept the current situation, demonstrating Normalcy Bias because he's clinging to the initial normal state despite evidence to the contrary. So the added dialogue should clearly show that he's dismissing the actual circumstances because he believes the situation should still be as it was when they arrived. Therefore, a line like, \"This shouldn't be happening, everything was normal when we parked!\" would make the Normalcy Bias explicit.\n</think>\n\n\"Don't worry, the truck will move on its own like it always does\u2014this situation isn't as bad as it looks!\""
