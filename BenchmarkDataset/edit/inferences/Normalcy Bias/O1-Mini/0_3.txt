    "example": "I (F21) and my boyfriend (M23) of five years went to my favorite restaurant a few weeks ago. The meal was great and we both really enjoyed ourselves. It was perfect, a completely perfect dinner. I paid the $60 check and we went out to the parking lot to the car. I live in a huge college town along with that Saturday night being a senior ball so the town was busy.\n\nWe get back to the car and the cars surrounding it was parked exactly the same as they were when we went in. There were cars to each side of his car along with a truck parallel parked behind him at least two car lengths away. In front of him was the wall of the restaurant and behind him was the roadway in the parking lot then the parallel parked truck at a distance to clarify.\n\nHe starts to back out of the space and after a few tries he says he can\u2019t do it. I say instantly I can spot him so he can get out. He says no and that it won\u2019t help him because the truck behind him wasn\u2019t there when he pulled into the spot and he was scared of hitting it. (It was there when he pulled into the spot.) He also added he doesn\u2019t want others to see me spotting him like he can\u2019t handle his vehicle. I say okay, I\u2019ll go into the restaurant and find the owner of one of the car and ask if there was any way they would move so he could get out, didn\u2019t want to but it was the only choice. He says no and kinda flips his shit (throwing his hat and sunglasses into the dash in frustration and also flooring it as if he\u2019s going to hit the building then slamming on the break before he does so.) He calls his parents screaming about not being able to get out of the spot and even locked my door when I tried to get out of the vehicle to go get someone else to help/spot him.\n\nAlso when he is on the phone the owner of one of the neighboring cars comes outside. I try to tell him that we talk to her but he ignored me and kept complaining to his parents how there was no way we were getting out of the spot. The owner of the neighboring car gets in another car and leaves while my boyfriend gets off the phone and says: \u201cguess we\u2019re stuck.\u201d\n\nThe screaming and me begging him to just let me spot him continues for 20 minutes and he makes a few jabs that I don\u2019t have a license so I wouldn\u2019t understand how he feels. At that point I was really upset and in tears. I had just taken him out to dinner and spent a pretty good amount of money for him to show his ass? Finally he lets me out of the car to spot him and within 2 minutes we are out of the spot.\n\nLater that night I told him that he ruined the night and the dinner I paid for for absolutely no reason. I also added that he always has to find away to destroy any date or thing in general I want to do just because it\u2019s not something he picks. He said that what happened was my fault because I should\u2019ve have not spoken to him because it made him more frustrated when he was trying to find a \u201csolution to the problem.\u201d AITA here?",
