But as I was waiting for my wife I saw a girl that looked to be about 14 years old walking with her little sister. This girl lives in our building with her family. But because we live in New York City there\u2019s concrete practically everywhere and it was wet. And in our building we have a parking lot for the whole complex, but the ground was wet because they had been cleaning. The girl was carrying her little sister who\u2019s about 3, and she slipped and fell on the concrete. She landed on what looked to be her butt and lower back, while she made sure her sister didn\u2019t hit the ground.\n\nI had my windows down and could hear the girl yelp as she hit the ground, and you could hear her hit the ground. She then stayed where she was for about 45 seconds all the while making sure her sister was okay. She then helped her sister up and then got up off the ground. But when she started walking she had a noticeable limp that wasn\u2019t there before she fell. I then went back to minding my own business after the girl wasn\u2019t in my line of sight anymore. My wife then got back in the car and told me she had seen the girl fall and that she spoke to her to make sure she was okay. And then she asked me why I hadn\u2019t said anything to make sure she wasn\u2019t seriously injured seeing that her parents weren\u2019t with her. And I told her that I didn\u2019t care because she wasn\u2019t my kid.\n\nMy wife then told me the least I could\u2019ve done was warn her about the ground being wet. So again I told her not my kid not my problem. She then said how if that was our kid then we would\u2019ve wanted someone to warn her, but seeing as she\u2019s not my kid I don\u2019t care what happens to her. So AITA for not asking the girl if she was okay?",
