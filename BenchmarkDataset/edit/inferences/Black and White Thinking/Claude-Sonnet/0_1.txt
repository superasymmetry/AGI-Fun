    "example": "Husband and I have been together for overn year, married for 25. He has always been blunt to the point of rude, calling a spade a f***ing spade.\n\nHis father passed away a month ago, and during the funeral planning and preparation I made a few gaffes.\n\nHe has a brother, whose wife is anything BUT incompetent. She works as an event organiser so she took on the task of organising the funeral book. I offered to organise the music, and slideshow. When giving my number to the Funeral director, I went blank and forgot it, looking quite foolish.\n\nThe following week, I sent a message to the WhatsApp chat that I hadn't checked and was full of spelling mistakes. I also missed the autocorrect that changed \"slideshow\" into \"sideshow\". However the service was beautiful and went off without an issue.\n\nA couple of weeks later, my husband was angry because we were having issues starting my daughter's car. I was unable to start it causing more issues (battery) and he screamed about bring surrounded by \"f***ing incompetent\" people. When I asked if meant me, he ranted about my issues during the funeral planning.\n\nI was upset at being spoken to that way and let him know it. He said sorry and put it down to stress and grief. This was two weeks ago. Last night he called me incompetent again because I had to get a password reset to access my work personnel file (it's a website that we hardly ever use, I may login once a year).\n\nWhile all this does make me sound like a complete idiot, it should be said that we have 3 kids, and i take on most of the responsibilities for the household (except the bills). Out daughter are now grown, but when they were younger he travelled a lot and I was on my own for weeks at a time.\n\nI am also good at my job, and have been given more responsibilities in the last year including being made a mentor to other employees.\n\nHowever I can be a bit of an airhead and ditzy.\n\nIn the past, people have noted the way my husband speaks to me, and have said he is too harsh and I deserve better.\n\nI tried to leave a couple of years ago, but he convinced me to give him another chance. But I wonder this time did I deserve to be called incompetent?\n\nIf you made it this far, thank you. I just can't tell what is fair criticism and verbal abuse anymore.",
