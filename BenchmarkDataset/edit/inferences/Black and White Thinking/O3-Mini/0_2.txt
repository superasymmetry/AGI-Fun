I\u2019ve always tried to introduce him to the literature and poetry and tried to find ones I thought he would like. He still struggles but I never mind, I have only showed him those things for his enjoyment not to change him. To me they way is speaks is simply how she speaks. Recently he has discovered chat GBT and uses it to help with some things that need to sound more put together like resumes or letters to a boss (I used to help him with these). However yesterday when I got my birthday card I could tell most of it was ai generated. There was only one bit at the end that included a line that we say to each other that I knew was him. I don\u2019t know how to feel. I\u2019m sad that the card didn\u2019t feel genuine or real. I felt like there was no effort into me. I wouldn\u2019t have minded if it was completely all over the place with no proper grammar if it was from the heart. But it was a long heartfelt whole card long thing that I know was from chat GBT. He wasn\u2019t home to see me open the card and I\u2019m relieved because he was so excited for me to read it and now I feel like it\u2019s because he was hoping I would think he improved but my face would have said it all. AIO. I feel like the reason he used it was to try and make me happy and maybe I should take that and appreciate it at the same time I would\u2019ve preferred something that came from him.",
