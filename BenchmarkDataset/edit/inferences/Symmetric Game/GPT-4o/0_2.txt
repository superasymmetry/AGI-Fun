    "inferences": "To make this scenario not an instance of a symmetric game, we need to adjust the payoffs such that the payoffs for corresponding choices are not identical for both players. This means that the choices available to John and Alexa result in different payoffs even when they select the same strategy combination.\n\nLet's modify the payoffs such that:\n\n- If both dress down, Alexa is more comfortable than John, perhaps because she is more used to casual clothing, so the payoff becomes +6 for Alexa and +4 for John.\n- If both dress up, John is less comfortable than Alexa, as he might find formal attire less bothersome, so the payoff becomes +3 for Alexa and +1 for John.\n- If John dresses up and Alexa dresses down, John still feels awkward about being overdressed, but Alexa gains some advantage from being the more casually dressed, making the payoffs -10 for John and -8 for Alexa.\n- Conversely, if John dresses down and Alexa dresses up, John feels more awkward, as he believes he's underdressed, so the payoffs become -8 for John and -10 for Alexa.\n\nThis setup ensures that the game is not symmetric, as the payoffs are not identical when reversing the roles.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n\n[[ (4,6), (-8,-10) ],\n [ (-10,-8), (1,3) ]]",
