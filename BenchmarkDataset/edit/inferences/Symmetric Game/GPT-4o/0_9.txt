    "inferences": "To alter the example provided so that it no longer represents a symmetric game, we need to adjust the payoffs such that either the strategies or the payoffs differ between the players.\n\nIn a symmetric game, the strategies and payoffs are the same for both players if their roles are reversed. Here\u2019s how we can adjust the payoffs:\n\nAlex\u2019s payoffs:\n- If both study: Alex passes, utility = +1\n- If only Alex studies: Alex passes, utility = +1\n- If only Laura studies: Alex does not pass, utility = 0\n- If neither studies: Alex does not pass, utility = 0\n\nLaura\u2019s payoffs:\n- If both study: Laura passes, utility = +2 (since she loves learning and gets extra satisfaction)\n- If only Laura studies: Laura passes, utility = +2\n- If only Alex studies: Laura does not pass, utility = -1 (negative impact if only the other passes)\n- If neither studies: Laura does not pass, utility = -1\n\nNow, the altered situation makes it so that the payoffs are different when Alex and Laura roles are reversed, breaking the symmetry.\n\nUsing these distinct payoffs, we can create a payoff matrix reflective of a non-symmetric game for both players. \n\n<OUTPUT>\n\n[[ (1,2), (1,-1) ],\n [ (0,2), (0,-1) ]]",
