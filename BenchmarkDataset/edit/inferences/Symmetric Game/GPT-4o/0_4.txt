For this scenario, let's redefine the payoffs so that both players have the same values in each scenario:\n\n1. Both go to Bakey: Both receive +2.\n2. Both go to Life Alive: Both receive -2.\n3. One goes to Bakey and the other to Life Alive: For simplicity, let's make sure both players receive symmetrical payoffs that reflect the negative situation, say -100 for both when separated.\n\nNow, each payoff is symmetric because switching identities (from Steven to Bob and vice versa) does not alter the strategy or expected utility for either player, and each player's decision equally impacts their respective payoffs.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (2,2), (-100,-100) ],\n [ (-100,-100), (-2,-2) ]]\n",
