    "inferences": "To transform the current scenario into a Symmetric Game, the players must have identical strategies and payoffs when placed in similar situations. This requires redefining Max's and Anna's preferences such that the game is symmetric.\n\nIn a symmetric game, the payoffs depend only on the strategies employed, not on who is playing them. Thus, Max and Anna should have the same options and receive equivalent payoffs when they choose the same strategies relative to one another.\n\nLet's redefine the setup:\n\nMax and Anna both derive utility from attending Harvard or MIT, but neither has a preference based on ranking. Instead, their utilities are based on whether they are at the same or different universities:\n\n- If both choose Harvard, each gets a utility of +50.\n- If both choose MIT, each gets a utility of +50.\n- If they choose different universities (one at Harvard, the other at MIT), each gets a utility of +75.\n\nThis new setup ensures that the payoffs are symmetric since the situation and outcome are identical for both players when strategies are exchanged.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (50,50), (75,75) ],\n [ (75,75), (50,50) ]]\n",
