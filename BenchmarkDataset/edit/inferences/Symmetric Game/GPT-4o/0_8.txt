    "inferences": "To transform the given situation into a symmetric game, we need to ensure that both players (Alex and Laura) have identical payoff structures for equivalent actions. Let's redefine the game such that Alex's utility matches the asymmetric interest derived from passing, thus ensuring both players gain an uniform utility from passing, irrespective of their intrinsic motivations.\n\nLet's redefine their payoffs:\n\n1. Both players receive a utility payoff of +1 from passing the exam.\n2. If either or both choose to study, both pass. If neither chooses to study, neither passes. \n3. Both Alex and Laura have a utility of 0 for not passing.\n4. Additionally, we give both Alex and Laura an intrinsic utility of +1 from the act of studying itself, independent of passing, allowing us to model intrinsic motivation identically.\n\nWith these modifications, the payoffs for each outcome remain uniform for both players, making the game symmetric.\n\nNow, let's set up the symmetric payoff matrix:\n\nActions available:\n- S = Study\n- NS = Not Study\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (2,2), (0,1) ],\n [ (1,0), (0,0) ]]\n",
