The key is to ensure that the rewards for matching strategies are equal for both Bob and Sally. Here is the adjusted scenario:\n\nBoth Bob and Sally have two options: they can either both write their sections for a computer science audience or both for an economics audience. If they choose the same audience, they both receive equal payoffs due to the consistency of their collaboration in terms of the target audience for the EC conference. If they choose different audiences, the paper will be rejected, leading to a payoff of 0 for both.\n\nHere\u2019s the symmetric payoff structure:\n- If both write for a computer science audience: both receive a payoff of +1.\n- If both write for an economics audience: both receive a payoff of +1.\n- If one writes for a computer science audience and the other for an economics audience: both receive a payoff of 0.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (1,1), (0,0) ],\n [ (0,0), (1,1) ]]\n",
