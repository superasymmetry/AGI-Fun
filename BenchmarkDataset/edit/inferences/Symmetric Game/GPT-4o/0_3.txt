This means the payoff for making a particular choice should be the same for both John and Alexa when they make that choice in similar situations. \n\nWe can modify the payoffs such that if both players dress up, they each have the same payoff, and likewise, if they dress down, they also each have the identical payoff. \n\nRevised Payoffs:\n- Both dress up: Each player gets +3 (They both feel stylish and enjoy the occasion)\n- Both dress down: Each gets +5 (They both feel comfortable)\n- One dresses up and the other dresses down: Each gets -10 (They both feel awkward about the mismatch)\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (3,3), (-10,-10) ],\n [ (-10,-10), (5,5) ]]\n",
