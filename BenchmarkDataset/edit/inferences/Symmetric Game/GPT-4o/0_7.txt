Here's one way to modify the scenario:\n\nMax and Anna are both deciding whether to attend Harvard or MIT for an economics PhD. Max is obsessed with rankings and will derive +100 utility from going to MIT and 0 utility from going to Harvard. Anna, however, values different aspects beyond just rankings. While Anna still hates Max's obsession with rankings, she will gain +50 utility from MIT and +20 utility from Harvard due to other factors like location and faculty preferences.\n\nNow, due to the differences in their utility values for attending the same institutions, the game is not symmetric because even if Max and Anna chose the same option, their utilities are not equal. \n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (100,50), (0,20) ],\n [ (0,50), (100,20) ]]\n",
