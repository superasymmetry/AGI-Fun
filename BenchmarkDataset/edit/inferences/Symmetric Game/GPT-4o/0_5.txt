    "inferences": "To make this example not an instance of a symmetric game, we need to change the payoffs such that the roles of the players are not interchangeable, resulting in an asymmetric game. In the original setup, both players get the same utility for choosing the same strategy, so we'll alter the individual utilities or rewards so that the players have different preferences or payoffs.\n\nLet's assume that Bob cares more about the proximity of the location compared to Steven, and Steven values the funny story even more when they choose Life Alive.\n\nHere's the modified scenario:\n- If Steven and Bob both choose Bakey, Steven gets +2 and Bob gets +3 for the nearby choice.\n- If both choose Life Alive, Steven's payoff is +98 due to caring less about the distance, deriving extreme enjoyment from the story he can share, while Bob gets -2.\n- If Steven chooses Bakey while Bob chooses Life Alive, Steven gets +2, and Bob gets -5 for the inconvenience.\n- If Bob chooses Bakey while Steven chooses Life Alive, Bob gets +3, but Steven gets -5.\n\nHere\u2019s how the new payoff matrix should look, reflecting these changes:\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (2,3), (-5,3) ],\n [ (98,-2), (2,-5) ]]\n",
