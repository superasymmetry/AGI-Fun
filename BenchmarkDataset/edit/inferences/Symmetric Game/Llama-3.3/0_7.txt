    "inferences": "To change the given example so that it's not an instance of a symmetric game, we need to modify the payoffs for Max and Anna such that their payoffs are not the same when the situation is reversed. \n\nIn the original example, both Max and Anna derive +100 utility from going to MIT and 0 utility from going to Harvard. This means that regardless of the choice the other person makes, the payoffs for each individual are the same when they choose MIT or Harvard. \n\nTo make it asymmetric, let's modify Anna's payoffs so that she gets a different utility from going to MIT or Harvard depending on Max's choice. For instance, Anna could get +100 utility if she and Max both go to MIT, but she gets +50 utility if she goes to MIT and Max goes to Harvard. On the other hand, if Anna goes to Harvard, she gets 0 utility regardless of Max's choice.\n\nHere's the modified payoff matrix:\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (100,100), (0,50) ],\n [ (0,0), (0,0) ]]",
