    "inferences": "To make the given example an instance of a symmetric game, we need to ensure that the payoff matrix is symmetric. This means that the payoffs for both players should be the same when they choose the same actions.\n\nIn the given example, Bob is a computer scientist and Sally is an economist. When both write for a computer science audience, Bob gets a payoff of +2 and Sally gets a payoff of +1. When both write for an economics audience, Bob gets a payoff of +1 and Sally gets a payoff of +2.\n\nTo make the game symmetric, we can modify the payoffs so that both players get the same payoff when they choose the same actions. Let's assume that when both players write for a computer science audience, they both get a payoff of +1.5. When both players write for an economics audience, they both get a payoff of +1.5.\n\nHere is the modified payoff matrix:\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (0,0), (0,0) ],\n [ (0,0), (1.5,1.5) ]]\n\nHowever, the above matrix does not fully represent the original problem. To fully represent the original problem in a symmetric game, we need to adjust the payoffs so that they are the same for both players when they choose the same actions, and also consider the payoffs when one player writes for a computer science audience and the other writes for an economics audience.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the payoffs. When one player writes for a computer science audience and the other writes for an economics audience, both players get a payoff of 0. This is already symmetric.\n\nWhen both players write for a computer science audience, let's say both get a payoff of x. When both players write for an economics audience, let's say both get a payoff of y.\n\nTo make the game symmetric, we can choose x and y such that they are equal. Let's choose x = y = 1.5.\n\nHowever, the original problem states that Bob gets a payoff of +2 when both write for a computer science audience, and Sally gets a payoff of +1. To make the game symmetric, we need to adjust these payoffs so that they are the same for both players.\n\nLet's choose the payoffs such that when both players write for a computer science audience, both get a payoff of 1.5, and when both players write for an economics audience, both get a payoff of 1.5.\n\nHere is the modified payoff matrix:\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (1.5,1.5), (0,0) ],\n [ (0,0), (1.5,1.5) ]]",
