    "inferences": "To convert the given example into a symmetric game, we need to ensure that the payoffs for both players are the same when they take the same actions. \n\nIn the original example, Alex and Laura have different motivations and utility functions. Alex cares about passing and gets +1 utility from passing, while Laura loves to learn and gets +1 utility from studying. \n\nTo make the game symmetric, we can modify the utility functions so that both players have the same preferences. Let's assume both Alex and Laura get +1 utility from studying and +1 utility from passing. \n\nThe passing grade is 5 percentage points below the average score. If both study, the average score is (95+95)/2 = 95, and the passing grade is 95 - 5 = 90. If both don't study, the average score is (50+50)/2 = 50, and the passing grade is 50 - 5 = 45. If one studies and the other doesn't, the average score is (95+50)/2 = 72.5, and the passing grade is 72.5 - 5 = 67.5.\n\nWhen both study, both pass and get +2 utility (+1 for studying and +1 for passing). When both don't study, both pass and get +0 utility (0 for not studying and +0 for passing, since passing doesn't give them any additional utility in this case, but they don't get the +1 for studying). When one studies and the other doesn't, the one who studies passes and gets +2 utility (+1 for studying and +1 for passing), and the one who doesn't study fails and gets +0 utility (0 for not studying and 0 for not passing).\n\nHere is the payoff matrix for the symmetric game:\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (2,2), (2,0) ],\n [ (0,2), (0,0) ]]",
