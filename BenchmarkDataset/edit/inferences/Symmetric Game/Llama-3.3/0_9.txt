    "inferences": "To make the given example not an instance of a symmetric game, we need to introduce an asymmetry in the payoffs or the strategy sets of the two players. Let's modify the example by changing the utility functions of Alex and Laura.\n\nInitially, both Alex and Laura derive +1 utility from passing and 0 utility from not passing. To break the symmetry, let's assume that Alex now derives +2 utility from passing if he studies, while Laura derives +1 utility from passing regardless of whether she studies or not. However, we also introduce a new condition: if Laura studies and passes, she gets an additional +1 utility, making her total utility +2.\n\nGiven the raw scores and the passing grade condition, we can analyze the possible outcomes:\n\n1. Both Alex and Laura study: They both get 95/100, the average score is 95/100, and the passing grade is 90/100. Both pass, so Alex gets +2 utility, and Laura gets +2 utility (since she studied and passed).\n\n2. Alex studies, Laura does not: Alex gets 95/100, Laura gets 50/100, the average score is 72.5/100, and the passing grade is 67.5/100. Both pass, so Alex gets +2 utility, and Laura gets +1 utility.\n\n3. Alex does not study, Laura studies: Alex gets 50/100, Laura gets 95/100, the average score is 72.5/100, and the passing grade is 67.5/100. Both pass, so Alex gets +1 utility (since he didn't study, he only gets the base passing utility), and Laura gets +2 utility.\n\n4. Neither Alex nor Laura studies: They both get 50/100, the average score is 50/100, and the passing grade is 45/100. Both pass, so Alex gets +1 utility, and Laura gets +1 utility.\n\nThe payoff matrix for this modified game is:\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (2,2), (2,1) ],\n [ (1,2), (1,1) ]]",
