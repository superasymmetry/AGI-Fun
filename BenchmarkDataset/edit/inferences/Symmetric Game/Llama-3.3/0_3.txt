    "inferences": "To make the given example an instance of a symmetric game, we need to ensure that the payoff matrix is symmetric, meaning that the payoffs for each player are the same when the strategies are reversed. \n\nIn the original example, if both dress up, John gets a payoff of +2 and Alexa gets a payoff of -3. To make the game symmetric, we need to change this so that both players get the same payoff when both dress up. \n\nLet's change the payoff for both dressing up to (+2, +2) or any other pair of equal payoffs, but to keep the rest of the payoffs the same and still make it symmetric, we could adjust the payoffs for both dressing up to be (-3, -3) or any other pair of equal payoffs that fits the given conditions, but since we want to keep the other payoffs the same, we can change the payoff for both dressing up to be (-3, -3) and adjust the other payoffs accordingly.\n\nHowever, we must keep in mind the original conditions and adjust them to fit a symmetric game. If one dresses up and the other dresses down, both get a payoff of -10. If both dress down, both get a payoff of +5. \n\nSo the adjusted payoffs could be: \n- If both dress up: (-3, -3)\n- If both dress down: (+5, +5)\n- If one dresses up and the other dresses down: (-10, -10)\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (-10, -10), (+5, +5) ],\n [ (+5, +5), (-3, -3) ]]",
