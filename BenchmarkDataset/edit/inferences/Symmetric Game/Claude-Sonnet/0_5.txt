In a symmetric game, both players have the same set of available strategies and the payoffs for playing particular strategies are the same for all players.\n\nTo make it asymmetric, let's modify the payoffs so that:\n1. Bob gets a much bigger kick out of making fun of Steven (+100 remains)\n2. Steven actually gets embarrassed and dislikes being teased (negative payoff instead of positive)\n3. The baseline preferences for the restaurants are different for each player\n    - Steven really likes Life Alive's healthy food (+3 for him)\n    - Bob strongly prefers Bakey's comfort food (+4 for him)\n    - Each dislikes the other restaurant differently\n\nThis creates natural asymmetry since their basic preferences and the social interaction payoffs are now different.\n\nWorking it out:\n- Steven's baseline: Bakey = +1, Life Alive = +3\n- Bob's baseline: Bakey = +4, Life Alive = -2\n- When they meet: Bob gets +100 bonus, Steven gets -50 penalty\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[(1,104), (1,-2)],\n [(3,4), (3,98)]]",
