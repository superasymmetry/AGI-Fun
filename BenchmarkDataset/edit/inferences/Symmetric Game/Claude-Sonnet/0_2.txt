Let's make it asymmetric by considering that John and Alexa have different preferences and circumstances.\n\nLet's say:\n- John works at a very casual tech startup, so dressing up is quite uncomfortable for him and doesn't come naturally\n- Alexa works in a formal corporate environment, so she's very comfortable in formal attire and actually prefers it\n\nNew scenario:\nWhen both dress up:\n- Alexa gets +8 (she's comfortable and happy)\n- John gets 0 (he's uncomfortable but at least matches)\n\nWhen both dress down:\n- Alexa gets +2 (slightly uncomfortable but manageable)\n- John gets +7 (very comfortable)\n\nWhen John dresses up and Alexa dresses down:\n- John gets -12 (extremely uncomfortable and mismatched)\n- Alexa gets -8 (feels awkward about the mismatch)\n\nWhen John dresses down and Alexa dresses up:\n- John gets -8 (feels awkward about the mismatch)\n- Alexa gets -12 (very uncomfortable with the mismatch)\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (0,8), (-12,-8) ],\n [ (-8,-12), (7,2) ]]",
