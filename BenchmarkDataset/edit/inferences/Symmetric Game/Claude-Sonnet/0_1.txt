This naturally means they would have different payoffs based on their expertise and comfort with different audiences.\n\nIf both write for a computer science audience:\n- Bob (CS expert) gets +3 (very comfortable)\n- Sally (economist) gets +1 (less comfortable)\n\nIf both write for an economics audience:\n- Bob (CS expert) gets +1 (less comfortable)\n- Sally (economist) gets +4 (very comfortable)\n\nIf they write for different audiences:\n- Both still get 0 (paper gets rejected due to inconsistency)\n\nThis makes the game asymmetric because:\n1. The payoffs are no longer identical when swapping roles\n2. Each player has different preferences based on their background\n3. The maximum payoffs are different for each player\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (3,1), (0,0) ],\n [ (0,0), (1,4) ]]",
