Both players should have the same choices\n2. The payoff for playing strategy X against strategy Y should be the same for both players\n3. When the roles are reversed, the payoffs should be identical\n\nLet's modify the scenario to make it symmetric:\nBoth students care only about their relative performance and getting ahead of the curve. We'll remove the different motivations (Alex's grade focus vs. Laura's love of learning) and make them identical.\n\nWhen both study, they get the same score and neither gets ahead, so they each get 0 utility.\nWhen one studies and the other doesn't, the studying student gets ahead and receives +1 utility, while the non-studying student falls behind and gets -1 utility.\nWhen neither studies, they get the same score and neither gets ahead, so they each get 0 utility.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (0,0),  (1,-1) ],\n [ (-1,1), (0,0)  ]]",
