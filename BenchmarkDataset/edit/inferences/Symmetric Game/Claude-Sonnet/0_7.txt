    "inferences": "Let me help modify this scenario to make it not symmetric by giving different payoffs to Max and Anna.\n\nLet's change it so that:\n\n- Max still prefers MIT strongly (gets +100 from MIT, 0 from Harvard)\n- But Anna now actually prefers Harvard (gets +80 from Harvard, +20 from MIT)\n\nThis makes the game asymmetric because:\n1. The players have different preferences\n2. Their payoff values are different for the same strategies\n3. If we were to swap the players' positions, we would get different outcomes\n\nSo now Max cares about rankings while Anna actually prefers Harvard's teaching style and research focus, making their utilities completely different from each other.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (0,80), (100,20) ],\n [ (0,80), (100,20) ]]",
