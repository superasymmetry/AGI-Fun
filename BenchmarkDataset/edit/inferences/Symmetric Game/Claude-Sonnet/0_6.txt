    "inferences": "Let me help transform this into a symmetric game. In a symmetric game, the payoff for playing a particular strategy must be the same for all players when they face the same situation. This means that the players are interchangeable.\n\nInstead of having different preferences, let's make both players have the same preferences and payoff structure. We can modify this to be about two students deciding between Harvard and MIT, where:\n\n1. Both students prefer to be at different universities (perhaps to avoid competition or to expand their professional network)\n2. When they choose different universities, each gets a payoff of 100\n3. When they choose the same university, each gets a payoff of 0\n\nThis creates symmetry because:\n- Both players have identical strategies (Harvard or MIT)\n- Both players get the same payoffs in identical situations\n- The payoffs for Player 1 choosing Harvard while Player 2 chooses MIT are the same as Player 1 choosing MIT while Player 2 chooses Harvard\n- The payoffs when both choose Harvard are the same as when both choose MIT\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (0,0), (100,100) ],\n [ (100,100), (0,0) ]]",
