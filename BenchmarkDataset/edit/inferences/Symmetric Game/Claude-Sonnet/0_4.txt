    "inferences": "Let me help transform this into a symmetric game. In a symmetric game, the payoff matrix should look identical if you swap the players' roles - meaning both players should face the exact same strategic situation.\n\nLet's modify the scenario to make it symmetric:\n\nTwo friends are deciding where to have a snack after class: either at Bakey (close by) or Life Alive (far). The basic utility for going to Bakey is +2 for either player, while going to Life Alive gives -2 due to the walk. However, if both players choose the same location, they each get an additional bonus of +3 from enjoying each other's company.\n\nLet's work out the payoffs:\n- If both go to Bakey: Each gets 2 (base) + 3 (company) = 5\n- If both go to Life Alive: Each gets -2 (base) + 3 (company) = 1\n- If they go to different places: One gets 2 (Bakey), other gets -2 (Life Alive), no bonus\n\nThis creates a symmetric game where both players face identical strategic situations.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (5,5),    (2,-2)  ],\n [ (-2,2),   (1,1)   ]]",
