    "inferences": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to change the given example so that it's not a symmetric game anymore. Let me first recall what a symmetric game is. In a symmetric game, the payoffs for each player depend only on the strategies chosen, not on who is playing them. So if both players switch their strategies, their payoffs switch accordingly. The original example probably had a symmetric structure, but I need to adjust it to break that symmetry.\n\nLooking at the original scenario: Max and Anna are choosing between Harvard and MIT. Max gets 100 from MIT, 0 from Harvard. Anna gets 0 from Harvard and 100 from MIT. Wait, that seems like if they both choose MIT, Max gets 100 and Anna also gets 100? Or maybe the original setup had different payoffs. Wait, the user's example says Max gets +100 from MIT and 0 from Harvard. Anna gets 0 from Harvard and +100 from MIT. So if both choose MIT, Max's utility is 100, Anna's is 100. If both choose Harvard, Max gets 0, Anna gets 0. If Max chooses MIT and Anna Harvard, then Max gets 100, Anna 0. If Max chooses Harvard and Anna MIT, Max 0, Anna 100. So the payoffs are (MIT, MIT) \u2192 (100,100); (MIT, Harvard) \u2192 (100,0); (Harvard, MIT) \u2192 (0,100); (Harvard, Harvard) \u2192 (0,0). \n\nWait, that's a symmetric game because the payoff matrix is symmetric. For example, if Max and Anna swap their strategies, their payoffs swap. So if Max plays MIT and Anna Harvard, Max gets 100, Anna 0. If they swap (Anna MIT, Max Harvard), then Anna gets 100, Max 0. So the matrix is symmetric. To make it asymmetric, I need to adjust the payoffs so that when players switch strategies, their payoffs aren't just swapped. \n\nSo the original matrix would look like:\n\n[[ (100,100), (100,0) ],\n [ (0,100), (0,0) ]]\n\nBut that's symmetric because the off-diagonal elements are (100,0) and (0,100), which are transposes. To break symmetry, I need to change at least one of the payoffs so that when the players switch strategies, their payoffs don't mirror each other. For example, if in one cell, the payoffs are different even after swapping. Let me think. Let's say when Max chooses MIT and Anna chooses Harvard, Max gets 100, Anna gets 50. Then when they swap (Anna MIT, Max Harvard), Anna would get 100, Max 50. But that's still symmetric in a way. Wait, no. If the original cell (MIT, Harvard) is (100,50), then swapping would lead to (50,100) in the cell (Harvard, MIT). But if the original cell (Harvard, MIT) is (something else), then it's not symmetric. Alternatively, maybe adjust the diagonal. For example, if both choose MIT, maybe Max gets 100, but Anna gets 80. Then that cell isn't symmetric. Or change one of the other cells. Let me try modifying one of the cells so that the payoffs aren't mirrored. For example, in the original example, when both choose Harvard, they both get 0. Let's say if both choose Harvard, Max gets 0 but Anna gets 20. Then the (Harvard, Harvard) cell would be (0,20), which breaks the symmetry. Alternatively, adjust another cell. Let me try making the (MIT, Harvard) cell have different payoffs. Suppose Max chooses MIT and Anna Harvard: Max gets 100, Anna gets 0. But if Anna chooses MIT and Max Harvard, maybe Anna gets 100 but Max gets 30. Then the matrix would have (MIT, Harvard) as (100,0) and (Harvard, MIT) as (30,100). That breaks the symmetry. Let me check:\n\nOriginal example's matrix:\n\nRow Player: Max (Player 1)\nColumn Player: Anna (Player 2)\n\nStrategies: MIT, Harvard.\n\nOriginal matrix (symmetric):\n\nMIT | Harvard\nMIT \u2192 (100,100), (100,0)\nHarvard \u2192 (0,100), (0,0)\n\nTo make it asymmetric, change one of the payoffs. Let's change the (Harvard, MIT) cell from (0,100) to (50,100). Then the matrix becomes:\n\nMIT | Harvard\nMIT \u2192 (100,100), (100,0)\nHarvard \u2192 (50,100), (0,0)\n\nNow, if we swap the players, the payoffs aren't mirrored. For example, if Max plays Harvard and Anna MIT, Max gets 50, Anna 100. If Anna were in Max's position (i.e., Anna plays Harvard and Max MIT), then Anna would get 0 (original (MIT, Harvard) cell is 100 for Max, 0 for Anna). Wait, no. Wait, in the matrix, the rows are Max's strategies, columns are Anna's. So if we swap their roles, the matrix would transpose. But in the modified matrix, the (Harvard, MIT) cell is (50,100), so the transposed cell (MIT, Harvard) is (100,0). These are different, hence asymmetric. Alternatively, another approach is to change the (MIT, MIT) cell. Suppose when both go to MIT, Max gets 100, Anna gets 90. Then the (MIT, MIT) cell is (100,90), which isn't symmetric. That would break symmetry. Similarly, changing (Harvard, Harvard) to (10,0) would also break symmetry. \n\nSo, any of these changes would make the game asymmetric. The key is that the payoff matrix is not symmetric when rows and columns are transposed. So I need to adjust at least one pair of corresponding cells to have different payoffs. Let me pick one. For example, let's modify the (Harvard, MIT) cell from (0,100) to (20,100). Then the matrix becomes:\n\n[[(100,100), (100,0)],\n [(20,100), (0,0)]]\n\nNow, transposing the matrix would swap the (Harvard, MIT) cell (20,100) with the (MIT, Harvard) cell (100,0). The transposed cell would be (100,0) in the (Harvard, MIT) position, but in the original matrix, it's (20,100). Hence, the matrix is not symmetric. Therefore, this would make the game asymmetric. Alternatively, changing another cell. Let's say when both choose Harvard, Max gets 0, but Anna gets 10. Then the (Harvard, Harvard) cell is (0,10), which breaks symmetry. So the matrix would be:\n\n[[(100,100), (100,0)],\n [(0,100), (0,10)]]\n\nThis is also asymmetric because the (Harvard, Harvard) cell has different payoffs for each player. Either approach works. Let me choose one. Let's go with modifying the (Harvard, MIT) cell to (20,100). Then the matrix is:\n\n[[(100, 100), (100, 0)],\n [(20, 100), (0, 0)]]\n\nThis should work. Let me verify. The original matrix was symmetric, so transposing it would give the same matrix. Now, after the change, transposing would result in:\n\nOriginal rows (Max's strategies: MIT, Harvard)\nColumns (Anna's strategies: MIT, Harvard)\n\nTransposed matrix (Anna as row player, Max as column player):\n\nAnna's strategies: MIT, Harvard\nMax's strategies: MIT, Harvard\n\nOriginal cell (MIT, Harvard) for Max is (100,0). In transposed matrix, this becomes (Harvard, MIT) for Anna, which would be (0,100) if symmetric. But in our modified matrix, (Harvard, MIT) is (20,100). So the transposed cell would be (0,100) for Anna's (Harvard, MIT), but in our case, it's (20,100). Hence, the matrix is not symmetric. Therefore, this makes the game asymmetric. Alternatively, changing another cell. Another option is to adjust the (MIT, Harvard) cell. Suppose when Max chooses MIT and Anna Harvard, Max gets 100, Anna gets 50. Then the matrix becomes:\n\n[[(100,100), (100,50)],\n [(0,100), (0,0)]]\n\nTransposing this would mean that when Anna chooses MIT and Max Harvard, Anna's payoff is 100 and Max's is 0. But in the original, when Max chooses MIT and Anna Harvard, Max gets 100, Anna 50. So transposed, that would be Anna choosing MIT and Max Harvard: Anna's payoff is 50, Max's 100. But in the matrix, the (Harvard, MIT) cell is (0,100), which is different. Wait, no. Let me clarify. The original matrix is from Max's perspective as row player. So the rows are Max's choices, columns Anna's. So the (MIT, Harvard) cell is Max choosing MIT, Anna Harvard: Max 100, Anna 50. Then, in the transposed matrix (Anna as row player, Max as column player), the (Harvard, MIT) cell would be Anna choosing Harvard, Max MIT: Anna's payoff is 50, Max's 100. But in the original matrix, the (Harvard, MIT) cell (Max Harvard, Anna MIT) is (0,100). So these are different, hence the game is asymmetric. \n\n",
