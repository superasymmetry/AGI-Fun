    "inferences": "Here's a modified example that makes the scenario a symmetric game:\n\n**Scenario:**\n\nAlice and Bob are working together on a co-authored paper to be submitted to a prestigious conference. Each of them independently needs to decide whether to emphasize the theoretical contributions of their work (T) or the practical applications (P). They have an imminent deadline, and whatever they choose will be submitted as is.\n\n*   **If both choose T (Theoretical):** Both Alice and Bob receive a payoff of +2.\n*   **If both choose P (Practical):** Both Alice and Bob receive a payoff of +1.\n*   **If Alice chooses T and Bob chooses P (or vice versa):** Both Alice and Bob receive a payoff of 0.\n\n**Explanation of Symmetry:**\n\nA game is symmetric if the payoffs depend only on the *strategies chosen* and *not on who chose which strategy*.  In other words:\n\n1.  **Identical Strategy Sets:** Both players (Alice and Bob) have the same possible actions:  {T, P}.\n2.  **Payoff Invariance:**  The payoff matrix is such that if Alice chooses T and Bob chooses P, Alice and Bob's payoffs are the same as if Bob chose T and Alice chose P.  The same holds true if both choose T or both choose P.\n\nThe original example was *not* symmetric because the payoffs were different when both players chose the same strategy (computer science or economics). The modified example eliminates this difference, making the game symmetric. The only thing that matters is whether both choose T, both choose P, or each chooses a different strategy. This can be summarized by the following matrix.\n\n|       | Bob: T | Bob: P |\n| :---- | :----- | :----- |\n| **Alice: T** |  2, 2    | 0, 0   |\n| **Alice: P** | 0, 0   |  1, 1    |\n",
