    "inferences": "Here's how we can change the example to make it a non-symmetric game:\n\n**The Change:**\n\nModify Laura's preferences. Instead of valuing passing the class in order to learn, assume she prefers getting a good grade, regardless of whether she actually studied and learned anything. She gets +1 utility from **achieving a score of 95 or higher** (meaning she studied, or Alex didn't), and 0 utility otherwise.\n\n**Why this makes it non-symmetric:**\n\n*   **Original Game (Symmetric):** The outcome depended on *relative* performance. Alex and Laura had identical incentives. The *role* each player played was interchangeable. If you swapped Alex and Laura's names and strategies, the game's structure remained the same. The payoffs from each outcome were identical.\n\n*   **Modified Game (Asymmetric):** Now, their preferences are fundamentally different. Alex cares about *passing* the class. Laura cares about achieving a high score *explicitly.*. Let's break this down:\n\n    *   **Alex's Payoffs:** Depend on whether he passes, which depends on both his own strategy *and* Laura's.\n    *   **Laura's Payoffs:** Depend on whether *she* gets a score of 95 or higher. If she studies, she gets a 95 and the utility. If she doesn't, and Alex studies, then she gets a 50, with 0 utility. If neither study, they both get 50, but the passing grade is 45. Both pass.\n\n    The two players no longer have the same incentives. If you swapped Alex and Laura, you'd be putting someone who cares about passing into a situation where high scores are the only thing that matters, and vice versa. The game is no longer unchanged.\n\n**The New Example (Asymmetric):**\n\nAlex and Laura are deciding whether or not to study for the upcoming final exam. The class is graded on a curve, and only relative performance matters, and they are the only two students in the class. For both Alex and Laura, studying leads to a raw score of 95/100, not studying leads to a raw score of 50/100. The passing grade in the class is set to be 5 percentage points below the average score in the class. Alex has no intrinsic motivation to learn and derives +1 utility from passing and 0 utility from not passing. Laura gets +1 utility if she achieves a score of 95 or higher and 0 utility otherwise.\n\n**In summary:** Asymmetric games feature players with different roles, strategies, incentives, or access to information. By making Laura care about a specific, absolute score (95+) rather than just passing, we break the symmetry.",
