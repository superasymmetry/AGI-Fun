    "inferences": "Here's the modified example to make it a symmetric game:\n\n**Max and Anna are both deciding whether to attend Harvard or MIT for an economics PhD.  Both Max and Anna prefer to be at the higher ranked university, but also prefer to attend different universities. If both attend the higher-ranked school, they both get +50. If one goes to the higher-ranked school and the other the lower, the person attending the higher-ranked school gets +100 and the other gets 0. If they both attend the lower-ranked school, they both get -50.**\n\n**Explanation of how this is a symmetric game:**\n\n*   **Same Players, Same Actions, Same Payoffs:** The core principle of a symmetric game is that all players are interchangeable. In this scenario:\n    *   Both players (Max and Anna) have the exact same action set: choose Harvard or MIT.\n    *   The payoffs are determined *solely* by the actions chosen, not by who chose which action. If both choose Harvard, *both* receive +50. If Max chooses Harvard and Anna chooses MIT, Max gets +100 and Anna gets 0, and *vice versa*. This is crucial.  The payoff structure is identical for both of them.\n\n*   **Interchangeability:**  Imagine swapping Max and Anna. If Anna chooses Harvard and Max chooses MIT, Anna *still* gets +100 and Max *still* gets 0. The outcome is determined by the combination of choices, not who makes those choices.\n\n*   **No Player-Specific Preferences:** There's no inherent asymmetry like one person caring about rankings and the other disliking the first person. Both players have the *same* preference structure: prefer higher-ranked school but want to go to a different school from one another.\n\n**In contrast, the original game was asymmetric because:**\n\n*   Max's utility came purely from the rank of the university, irrespective of Anna's choice.\n*   Anna's utility came from avoiding Max, irrespective of the ranking of the university she attends.\n*   Their payoffs were not determined by the same payoff structure.  Max's payoff depended on *which* school he attended, while Anna's depended on *who* she attended with.\n\nThis revised scenario sets up a symmetric game where both players are making the *same* decision, with the *same* possible actions, and the payoff consequences of those actions are identical regardless of which player took which action. This is the hallmark of a symmetric game.\n",
