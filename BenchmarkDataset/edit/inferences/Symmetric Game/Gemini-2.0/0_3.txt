    "inferences": "Here's the modified example to make it a Symmetric Game:\n\n**John and Alexa are going out for a first date at Live Alive Cafe. Both of them have two options; they can either dress up or dress down.  The payoffs depend only on the combination of actions, not on *who* takes which action.**\n\n*   **Both Dress Up:** Both John and Alexa get a payoff of +2. They might both feel good about making an effort, even if it's a bit uncomfortable.\n*   **Both Dress Down:** Both John and Alexa get a payoff of +5. They both feel comfortable and relaxed.\n*   **One Dresses Up, One Dresses Down:** Both John and Alexa get a payoff of -10.  They both feel awkward and mismatched, regardless of who is overdressed or underdressed.\n\n**Explanation of Changes and Symmetry:**\n\n*   **Removed Asymmetry in Payoffs:**  The original example had different payoffs for John and Alexa when they *both* dressed up. This is a key characteristic of an asymmetric game.  I've changed it so that if they both dress up, they *both* get the same payoff (+2).  The same is true if they both dress down (+5) and when one dresses up and one dresses down (-10).\n*   **Payoff Depends on Combination of Actions:** Now the payoffs depend entirely on the *combination* of actions taken, and not on which player took which action.  If you swap John and Alexa's strategies, the payoffs for each player remain the same.\n\n**Why this is now a Symmetric Game:**\n\nA symmetric game has the following key property:\n\n*   If you switch the players' strategies, the payoffs simply switch between them.  In the modified example, this is true, because regardless of their strategy they are getting the same payoff. This is because the payoff matrix is identical for both players.\n\n**Therefore, the modified scenario now represents a symmetric game.**\n",
