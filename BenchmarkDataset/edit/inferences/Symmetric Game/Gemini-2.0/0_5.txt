    "inferences": "Okay, here's a modification to the scenario that makes it an *asymmetric* game:\n\n**Steven and Bob are deciding where to have a snack after 14.163 lecture. They can either go to Bakey (close by) or Life Alive (a bit of a walk). As a baseline, both of them get utility +2 for going to the nearby Bakey, compared to -2 for going to the further away Life Alive. There\u2019s an extra complication this time though: Steven's brother is best friends with Bob. If Steven goes to the same location as Bob, then Bob will get a bonus payoff of +100 from being able to hang out with Steven's brother. If this happens, Steven will also get a penalty payoff of -100: Steven will derive great displeasure from having to deal with Bob and his brother. **\n\n**Why this is asymmetric:**\n\n*   **Different Payoff Structures:** In the original symmetric game, the payoff for Steven and Bob was a direct result of them going to the same place. In the modified game, the payoff is a result of them going to the same place AND Steven's brother being best friends with Bob.\n\n**Key Idea Behind Asymmetry**\n\nTo create an asymmetric game, you need to introduce a factor that affects the players differently *based on their identity* and the outcome. In this case, the fact that Bob is best friends with Steven's brother changes the payoff structure in a way that is unique to their individual situations. Bob benefits from it, and Steven loses. This breaks the symmetry.\n",
