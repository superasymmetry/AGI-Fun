    "inferences": "The key to making this *not* a symmetric game is to give Bob and Sally *different* payoffs for the *same* outcome. Currently, if they both choose CS, they both get +2; if they both choose Economics, they both get +1.\n\nHere's how we can change it:\n\n**Modified Example:**\n\nBob is working with Sally on a co-authored paper to be submitted to the Economics and Computation (EC) conference. Bob is tasked with writing an introduction, and Sally with writing a conclusion. Both Bob and Sally have two options: they can either write their sections targeting a computer science audience, or targeting an economics audience. They have an imminent deadline, and whatever they write will need to be submitted to EC without any further changes. If one person writes for a computer science audience and another writes for an economics audience, then both players will have a payoff of 0, because the EC reviewer will be confused about the paper\u2019s audience and therefore reject the paper. **If both write for a computer science audience, then Bob will have a payoff of +2 and Sally has a payoff of +3 (Sally is more strongly aligned with CS). If both write for an economics audience, then Bob will have a payoff of +1 while Sally gets a payoff of +2 (Sally has a higher reputation in the economics community than Bob does).**\n\n**Explanation of the Change:**\n\n*   **Different Payoffs for the Same Strategy Profile:** The crucial change is in the payoffs when both choose the same strategy. Now, if they both target a Computer Science audience, Bob gets +2 while Sally gets +3.  Similarly, if they both target an Economics audience, Bob gets +1 and Sally gets +2.\n\n*   **Why it's no longer symmetric:** A game is symmetric if the payoffs depend only on the strategies employed, *not* on who is playing them. More formally, if swapping the players' roles also swaps their payoffs. In this modified example, if we swap Bob and Sally, their payoffs for each strategy profile *change*. For example, in the original game, if Bob picked CS and Sally picked Economics the payoff to Bob was 0 and the payoff to Sally was 0. If the roles were reversed and Sally picked CS and Bob picked Economics, the payoff to Bob was 0 and the payoff to Sally was 0. In this case, the payoffs only depended on the strategies chosen. However, in the modified game, if Bob picks CS and Sally picks CS, Bob gets +2 and Sally gets +3. If Bob picks Econ and Sally picks Econ, Bob gets +1 and Sally gets +2. If we reverse the roles, i.e. Sally picks CS and Sally gets +2, and Bob gets +3. Therefore, swapping the players' roles has changed the payoffs, and the game is no longer symmetric.\n\nThis difference in payoffs makes the game asymmetric. The strategic considerations for Bob and Sally are now different because their personal gains are no longer perfectly aligned based solely on the audience they target.\n",
