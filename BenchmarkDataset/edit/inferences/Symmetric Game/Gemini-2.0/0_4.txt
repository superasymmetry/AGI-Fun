    "inferences": "Here's the revised scenario to make it a Symmetric Game:\n\n**Scenario: Snack Time Dilemma**\n\nTwo Econ students, let's call them Player A and Player B, are deciding where to grab a snack after a grueling lecture. They have two options:\n\n*   **Bakey (B):** A quick and convenient bakery nearby.\n*   **Life Alive (L):** A slightly further walk, but offers healthier options.\n\n**Payoff Structure:**\n\nBoth players have the same preferences and face the same consequences. They each receive a base utility of +2 from going to Bakey (B) and -2 from going to Life Alive (L).\n\nHere's where the symmetry comes in:\n\n*   **If BOTH players choose the same location, they both receive an ADDITIONAL payoff of -5.** This could represent the discomfort of intense eye contact with one another after a long day of game theory.\n\n*   **If the players choose DIFFERENT locations, they both receive an ADDITIONAL payoff of +5.** This could represent the relief of not having to deal with the awkward situation of intense eye contact.\n\n**Payoff Matrix:**\n\nHere's the payoff matrix representing this game:\n\n|          | Player B: Bakey (B) | Player B: Life Alive (L) |\n| -------- | -------------------- | ---------------------- |\n| Player A: Bakey (B)   | (2-5, 2-5) = (-3, -3)      | (2+5, -2+5) = (7, 3)         |\n| Player A: Life Alive (L) | (-2+5, 2+5) = (3, 7)         | (-2-5, -2-5) = (-7, -7)     |\n\n**Why is this a Symmetric Game?**\n\n*   **Identical Players:** The roles of Player A and Player B are interchangeable. Both players have the same options and face the exact same consequences based on their choice and the other player's choice.\n*   **Symmetric Payoff Matrix:** The payoff matrix is symmetric around the main diagonal.  If you swap Player A and Player B's positions, the payoffs remain the same.  This means that if Player A chooses Bakey and Player B chooses Life Alive, the payoffs are the same as if Player B chose Bakey and Player A chose Life Alive.\n\n**In contrast to the original scenario:**\n\nThe original scenario was *not* symmetric because Steven and Bob faced fundamentally different payoffs. Steven's payoff was heavily influenced by his date, while Bob's payoff was based on the opportunity to tease Steven.  This asymmetry violated the core principle of a symmetric game.\n",
