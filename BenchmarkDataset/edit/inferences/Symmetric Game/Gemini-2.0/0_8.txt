    "inferences": "Here's how we can modify the scenario to make it a symmetric game:\n\n**Modified Scenario: The Grading Game**\n\nAlex and Laura are deciding whether or not to study for the upcoming final exam. The class is graded on a curve, and only relative performance matters, and they are the only two students in the class. For both Alex and Laura, studying leads to a raw score of 95/100, not studying leads to a raw score of 50/100. The passing grade in the class is set to be the average score in the class. Both Alex and Laura are trying to decide whether or not to study, and **they both derive +1 utility from passing and 0 utility from not passing.**\n\n**Explanation of Symmetry**\n\n*   **Identical Players:**  The core of a symmetric game is that all players have the same roles, the same strategy sets, and their payoffs depend only on their own strategy and the strategies of the *other* players, *not* on who is playing which strategy.\n*   **Payoff Function:** The only change that was needed to make the game symmetric was to make the payoff function the same for both Alex and Laura.\n*   **Strategic Equivalence:**  Imagine swapping Alex and Laura.  The game remains the same. The only thing that determines each player's payoff is their own action (study or don't study) and the action of the other player.\n\n**Payoff Matrix (Illustrative)**\n\nTo further illustrate, let's create a payoff matrix (Alex's payoff listed first):\n\n|             | Laura Studies | Laura Doesn't Study |\n| ----------- | ------------- | -------------------- |\n| Alex Studies      |    1, 1   |   1, 0   |\n| Alex Doesn't Study |  0, 1   |  0, 0 |\n\n**Explanation of Payoffs**\n\n*   **(Alex Studies, Laura Studies):** Both get 95. The average is 95. The passing grade is 95. Both pass (Utility = 1).\n*   **(Alex Studies, Laura Doesn't Study):** Alex gets 95, Laura gets 50. The average is 72.5. The passing grade is 72.5. Alex passes, Laura does not (1, 0).\n*   **(Alex Doesn't Study, Laura Studies):** Alex gets 50, Laura gets 95. The average is 72.5. The passing grade is 72.5. Laura passes, Alex does not (0, 1).\n*   **(Alex Doesn't Study, Laura Doesn't Study):** Both get 50. The average is 50. The passing grade is 50. Neither pass (0, 0).\n\nIn this symmetric game, the best strategy for both players is to study. This results in both players passing, and receiving a utility of 1.\n",
