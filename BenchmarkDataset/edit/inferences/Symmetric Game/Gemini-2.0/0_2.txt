    "inferences": "Here's a modification of the scenario to make it *not* a symmetric game.  The key is to change the payoffs such that John and Alexa don't receive the same payoff for the same actions.\n\n**Modified Scenario:**\n\nJohn and Alexa are going out for a first date at Live Alive Cafe. Both of them have two options; they can either dress up or dress down.\n\n*   **If John dresses up and Alexa dresses down:** John gets a payoff of -5 (he feels overdressed), and Alexa gets a payoff of -10 (she feels underdressed).\n\n*   **If John dresses down and Alexa dresses up:** John gets a payoff of -10 (he feels underdressed), and Alexa gets a payoff of -5 (she feels overdressed).\n\n*   **If both dress down:** John gets a payoff of +5 (comfortable and relaxed), and Alexa gets a payoff of +2 (she wishes she had made more of an effort).\n\n*   **If both dress up:** John gets a payoff of +2 (he's presentable, but uncomfortable), and Alexa gets a payoff of +5 (she feels confident and stylish).\n\n**Explanation of Why It's No Longer Symmetric**\n\nA symmetric game requires that the payoffs are the same for both players if they switch strategies. In the original scenario, if John chose \"Dress Up\" and Alexa chose \"Dress Down,\" the payoffs were (-10, -10).  If they switched strategies (Alexa \"Dress Up,\" John \"Dress Down\"), the payoffs were still (-10, -10).\n\nIn the modified scenario, the payoffs for the \"Dress Up/Dress Down\" outcome depend on *who* is dressing up and *who* is dressing down. The payoffs are different if John is the one dressed up versus if Alexa is the one dressed up. Additionally, if they both dress down or dress up, each individual receives a different pay off.\n",
