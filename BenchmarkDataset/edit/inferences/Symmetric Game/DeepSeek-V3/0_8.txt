    "inferences": "To make this a symmetric game, both players must have identical payoff structures. Currently, Alex and Laura have different utility functions (Alex cares about passing, Laura cares about studying). We'll adjust the payoffs so that both players derive utility from passing the exam, and both face the same costs/benefits from studying.\n\nHere\u2019s the symmetric version:\n- Both players (Player 1 and Player 2) care about passing the exam, deriving +1 utility from passing and 0 from not passing.\n- Studying costs both players some utility (e.g., -1), as it requires effort.\n- The passing grade is still 5 percentage points below the average score in the class.\n\nThe payoffs are calculated as follows:\n1. If both study:\n   - Average score = (95 + 95)/2 = 95.\n   - Passing grade = 95 - 5 = 90.\n   - Both pass (95 > 90), but incur the cost of studying: (1 - 1, 1 - 1) = (0, 0).\n2. If Player 1 studies and Player 2 doesn\u2019t:\n   - Average score = (95 + 50)/2 = 72.5.\n   - Passing grade = 72.5 - 5 = 67.5.\n   - Player 1 passes (95 > 67.5), payoff = 1 - 1 = 0.\n   - Player 2 fails (50 < 67.5), payoff = 0 - 0 = 0.\n3. If Player 1 doesn\u2019t study and Player 2 does:\n   - Symmetric to the above: (0, 0).\n4. If neither studies:\n   - Average score = (50 + 50)/2 = 50.\n   - Passing grade = 50 - 5 = 45.\n   - Both pass (50 > 45), and neither incurs the cost of studying: (1, 1).\n\nThe symmetric payoff matrix is:\n\n[[ (0, 0), (0, 0) ],\n [ (0, 0), (1, 1) ]]",
