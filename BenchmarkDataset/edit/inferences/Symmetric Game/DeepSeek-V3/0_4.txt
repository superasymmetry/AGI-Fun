    "inferences": "To make this a symmetric game, we need to ensure that both players have the same payoff structure. In the original scenario, only Bob receives a bonus payoff when both choose the same location, while Steven is penalized. To create symmetry, we'll adjust the payoffs so that both players experience the same consequences when they choose the same location.\n\nHere\u2019s the symmetric version:\n- Both players get +2 for Bakey and -2 for Life Alive as baseline payoffs.\n- If both choose the same location, each gets a bonus payoff of +100 (mutual benefit, e.g., both can make fun of each other or enjoy the same location together). \n\nThis ensures the payoffs are symmetric for both players. Here\u2019s the resulting payoff matrix:\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (102, 102), (2, -2) ],\n [ (-2, 2), (98, 98) ]]\n</OUTPUT>",
