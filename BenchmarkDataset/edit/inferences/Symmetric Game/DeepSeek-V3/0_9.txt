The class is graded on a curve, and only relative performance matters, and they are the only two students in the class. For both Alex and Laura, studying leads to a raw score of 95/100, not studying leads to a raw score of 50/100. The passing grade in the class is set to be 5 percentage points below the average score in the class. Alex has no intrinsic motivation to learn and derives +1 utility from passing and 0 utility from not passing. Laura loves to learn but she only thinks she learns if she passes the class, so she gets +1 utility from passing and 0 utility from not passing. ",
