In this case, we can assume that both Alex and Laura have the same utility for passing and not passing, and the same utility for studying and not studying. This means that the payoffs for each player will be the same regardless of who makes the decision.\nLet's assume that the payoffs for passing are 1 and the payoffs for not passing are 0. Similarly, let's assume that the payoffs for studying are 1 and the payoffs for not studying are 0.\nThe payoff matrix for this symmetric game would be:\n[[ (1,1), (0,0) ],\n [ (0,0), (1,1) ]]\n<OUTPUT>[[ (1,1), (0,0) ],\n [ (0,0), (1,1) ]]",
