    "inferences": "To make the example not an instance of a symmetric game, we need to ensure that the payoffs for the two players are not the same for each possible outcome. In the original example, both players receive the same utility for going to Bakey (+2) and the same utility for going to Life Alive (-2). Additionally, both players receive the same bonus payoff (+100) if they go to the same location. To make the game asymmetric, we can change the payoffs for one of the players. For example, we can change the bonus payoff for Bob to +50 instead of +100. This would make the game asymmetric because the payoffs for the two players are no longer the same for each possible outcome. The new payoff matrix would be:\n[[ (2,2), (2,50) ],\n [ (-2,-2), (-2,50) ]]",
