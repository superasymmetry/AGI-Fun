For example, we can make the payoffs for Bob and Sally in the case where both write for a computer science audience to be +3 and +1 respectively, and in the case where both write for an economics audience to be +1 and +3 respectively. This way, the payoffs for Bob and Sally are not equal in each outcome, and the game is no longer symmetric.\nThe modified 2x2 payoff matrix would be:\n[[ (0,0), (3,1) ],\n [ (1,3), (0,0) ]]",
