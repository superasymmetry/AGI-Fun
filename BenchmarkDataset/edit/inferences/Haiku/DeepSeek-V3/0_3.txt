    "label": "yes",
    "inferences": "To ensure the resultant text is not an instance of a haiku, you could replace the blank with a phrase that disrupts the 5-7-5 syllable structure or introduces a non-seasonal/non-nature theme. For example:\n\n**\"A tired old\"**  \n\nResult:  \n*A tired old man  \nIt's better for you to wane  \nLet it float away*  \n\nThis adds two extra syllables to the first line (6 instead of 5), breaking the haiku form. Alternatively, you could use a non-nature word like **\"The programmer\"** to deviate from traditional haiku themes.  \n\nFinal answer (choose one):  \n- *\"A tired old\"*  \n- *\"The programmer\"*"
