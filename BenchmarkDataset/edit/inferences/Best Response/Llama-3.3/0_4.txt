    "inferences": "To ensure that the example is not an instance of the Best Response concept, we need to create a scenario where one player does not have a unique best response to the other player's strategy. \n\nLet's modify the payoffs as follows: \n- If both go to Bakey, Steven gets a payoff of -100 (due to his date being upset) and Bob gets +102 (the baseline +2 for going to Bakey and the bonus +100 for making fun of Steven).\n- If both go to Life Alive, Steven gets -2 (the baseline for going to Life Alive) and Bob gets -2 (the baseline for going to Life Alive, with no bonus).\n- If Steven goes to Bakey and Bob goes to Life Alive, Steven gets +2 (the baseline for going to Bakey) and Bob gets -2 (the baseline for going to Life Alive).\n- If Steven goes to Life Alive and Bob goes to Bakey, Steven gets -2 (the baseline for going to Life Alive) and Bob gets +2 (the baseline for going to Bakey).\n\nHowever, to make it not an instance of the Best Response, we should ensure that there's at least one scenario where a player is indifferent between two actions given the other player's choice. \n\nLet's adjust the payoffs so that if Bob goes to Bakey, Steven is indifferent between going to Bakey or Life Alive. We can achieve this by making Steven's payoff for going to Bakey (when Bob goes to Bakey) equal to his payoff for going to Life Alive (when Bob goes to Bakey). \n\nGiven that Steven's payoff for going to Life Alive (when Bob goes to Bakey) is -2, we should adjust his payoff for going to Bakey (when Bob goes to Bakey) to also be -2 + x, where x accounts for the bonus/penalty of being with Bob, but since we want indifference, the net payoff should be -2. \n\nHowever, we must remember the original bonus/penalty for being at the same location. So, if Steven and Bob are both at Bakey, Steven gets -100 (for his date being upset) and Bob gets +100 (for making fun of Steven). But to make Steven indifferent, we need to adjust the baseline payoffs or the bonus/penalty structure so that the net outcome for Steven is the same whether he chooses Bakey or Life Alive when Bob chooses Bakey.\n\nSince the original problem statement and adjustments lead to complex interactions, let's simplify to meet the requirement directly in the payoff matrix format, focusing on creating a scenario where one player does not have a unique best response.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (0, 10), (0, 0) ],\n [ (0, 0), (10, 0) ]]",
