    "inferences": "To make the given example not an instance of the Best Response concept in game theory, we need to ensure that there is at least one situation where a player has more than one best response to their opponent's strategy. The original payoff matrix for the game between John and Alexa can be represented as follows:\n\n- If John dresses up and Alexa dresses up, the payoff is (+2, +2).\n- If John dresses up and Alexa dresses down, the payoff is (-10, -10).\n- If John dresses down and Alexa dresses up, the payoff is (-10, -10).\n- If John dresses down and Alexa dresses down, the payoff is (+5, +5).\n\nThis gives us a payoff matrix of:\n[[ (+2, +2), (-10, -10) ],\n[ (-10, -10), (+5, +5) ]]\n\nTo modify this so it's not an instance of Best Response, we could adjust the payoffs so that for at least one of the strategies of one player, the other player has two equally good responses. Let's adjust the payoffs so that if Alexa dresses down, John has two strategies that yield the same payoff, thus not having a unique best response.\n\nLet's change the payoff for John when both dress down to (+2, +5), and the payoff when John dresses up and Alexa dresses down to (+2, -10), and keep the rest the same. However, to truly break the best response scenario, we need to ensure there's a scenario where a player is indifferent between two actions given the opponent's action. \n\nSo, let's adjust it further:\n- If John dresses up and Alexa dresses up, the payoff is (+2, +2).\n- If John dresses up and Alexa dresses down, the payoff is (+5, -10).\n- If John dresses down and Alexa dresses up, the payoff is (-10, -10).\n- If John dresses down and Alexa dresses down, the payoff is (+5, +5).\n\nThis adjustment makes John indifferent between dressing up or down when Alexa dresses down, as both yield him a +5 payoff, thus not having a unique best response.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (2, 2), (5, -10) ],\n[ (-10, -10), (5, 5) ]]",
