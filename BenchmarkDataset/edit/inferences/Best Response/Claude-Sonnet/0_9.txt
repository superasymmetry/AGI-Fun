The payoffs are structured as follows:\n\nAlex's preferences:\n- If Laura doesn't study, Alex gets utility of 2 from not studying (relaxing) and 1 from studying (unnecessary effort)\n- If Laura studies, Alex gets utility of 0 from not studying (fails badly) and 3 from studying (needs to keep up)\n\nLaura's preferences:\n- If Alex doesn't study, Laura gets utility of 3 from studying (gets ahead) and 1 from not studying\n- If Alex studies, Laura gets utility of 1 from studying and 2 from not studying (can relax while Alex works hard)\n\nThis creates a situation where:\n- If Alex doesn't study, Laura's best response is to study (3 > 1)\n- If Alex studies, Laura's best response is to not study (2 > 1)\n- If Laura doesn't study, Alex's best response is to not study (2 > 1)\n- If Laura studies, Alex's best response is to study (3 > 0)\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (2,1), (1,2) ],\n [ (0,3), (3,1) ]]",
