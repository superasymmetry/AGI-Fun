I'll do this by creating multiple equally good responses for at least one player in some situations, which violates the requirement of having exactly one best response.\n\nLet me adjust the payoffs:\n\nIf both write for a computer science audience, Bob gets +2 and Sally gets +2 (changed from +1)\nIf both write for an economics audience, Bob gets +2 (changed from +1) and Sally gets +2\nIf they write for different audiences, both still get 0\n\nNow, when Sally writes for an economics audience, Bob has two equally good options (economics or computer science), both giving him a payoff of 2. This breaks the best response concept since there isn't a unique best response.\n\nLet me put this into a matrix:\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (2,2), (0,0) ],\n [ (0,0), (2,2) ]]",
