    "inferences": "Let me think about how to modify this scenario to break the \"Best Response\" property.\n\nIn game theory, for a strategy to be a \"Best Response\", each player must have exactly one optimal choice for each possible strategy of their opponent. To break this, we need to create a situation where at least one player has either no best response or multiple best responses to at least one of their opponent's strategies.\n\nLet's modify the payoffs to create such a situation:\n\nIf one dresses up and the other dresses down, both still get -10 (awkward situation).\nIf both dress down, both get +5 (comfortable situation).\nIf both dress up, both get +5 (making this equal to dressing down).\n\nNow, when Alexa dresses down, John has two equally good responses:\n- If John dresses down, he gets +5\n- If John dresses up, he gets -10\nSo dressing down is still his best response.\n\nBut when Alexa dresses up:\n- If John dresses up, he gets +5\n- If John dresses down, he gets -10\nSo dressing up is his best response.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (5,5),  (-10,-10) ],\n [ (-10,-10), (5,5) ]]",
