To remove this property, I'll create a situation where at least one player has multiple equally good responses to the other's strategy.\n\nI'll modify the payoffs to make it so Steven would be indifferent between his choices when Bob chooses Bakey.\n\nLet's set it up:\n- Keep the base payoffs: +2 for Bakey, -2 for Life Alive\n- Modify the interaction payoffs to make Steven indifferent\n- When they meet: Instead of +100/-100, let's make Bob's bonus +4 and Steven's penalty -4\n\nThis means when Bob is at Bakey:\n- If Steven goes to Bakey: Steven gets (2-4 = -2)\n- If Steven goes to Life Alive: Steven gets (-2)\n\nNow Steven has no unique best response when Bob chooses Bakey, as both options give him -2.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (-2,6), (2,-2) ],\n [ (-2,-2), (-6,6) ]]",
