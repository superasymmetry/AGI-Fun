Steven goes to Life Alive, in response to Bob going to Bakey.**\n\n**Why this isn't a best response:**\n\n*   **Bob goes to Bakey.**\n\n*   **If Steven goes to Bakey:** His utility is +2 (baseline) - 100 (from the date getting angry) = -98.\n\n*   **If Steven goes to Life Alive:** His utility is -2 (baseline) - 6 (dislike) = -8.\n\nSince -8 is greater than -98, Steven's best response to Bob going to Bakey should be going to Life Alive. In the modified example, Steven did not choose his best response.\n",
