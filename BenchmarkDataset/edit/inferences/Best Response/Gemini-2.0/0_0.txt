    "inferences": "Here's a modified scenario where Bob writing for an economics audience is *not* a best response to Sally writing for an economics audience:\n\n**Modified Scenario:**\n\nBob is working with Sally on a co-authored paper to be submitted to the Economics and Computation (EC) conference. Bob is tasked with writing an introduction, and Sally with writing a conclusion. Both Bob and Sally have two options: they can either write their sections targeting a computer science audience, or targeting an economics audience. They have an imminent deadline, and whatever they write will need to be submitted to EC without any further changes.\n\n*   If one person writes for a computer science audience and another writes for an economics audience, then both players will have a payoff of 0.\n\n*   If both write for a computer science audience, then Bob will have a payoff of +2 while Sally only has a payoff of +1.\n\n*   If both write for an economics audience, then Bob will have a payoff of +1 while Sally gets a payoff of +2.\n\n**However, there's a crucial new element: Bob has a severe dislike of writing for an economics audience. No matter what Sally does, Bob always loses 1 point when writing for an economics audience.** So his payoff table becomes:\n\n*   If both write for a computer science audience, then Bob will have a payoff of +2 while Sally only has a payoff of +1.\n\n*   If both write for an economics audience, then Bob will have a payoff of 0 (1-1) while Sally gets a payoff of +2.\n\nBob writes for an economics audience, in response to Sally writing for an economics audience.\n\n**Explanation of why this is NOT a best response:**\n\nIf Sally writes for an economics audience, Bob now has the following choices:\n\n*   **Write for Economics Audience:** Bob's payoff is 0.\n*   **Write for Computer Science Audience:** Bob's payoff is 0 (because one writes for CS, and the other for Economics).\n\nIn this case, Bob is indifferent, so writing for the Economics audience is *a* best response, but not *the* best response.\n\n*Modified Scenario 2:*\n\nBob is working with Sally on a co-authored paper to be submitted to the Economics and Computation (EC) conference. Bob is tasked with writing an introduction, and Sally with writing a conclusion.

If Sally does well (i.e. she writes for Computer Science), then Bob gets a payoff of 1 in addition to his standard payoff, due to their coordination. If Sally does poorly (i.e. she writes for Economics), then Bob is very upset.
