    "inferences": "Here's a modified scenario where Max going to MIT is *not* a best response to Anna going to MIT.\n\n**Modified Scenario:**\n\nMax and Anna are both deciding whether to attend Harvard or MIT for an economics PhD. Max is obsessed with rankings, but his obsession now has a caveat:\n\n*   If both he and Anna go to MIT, the rankings are irrelevant, and he derives 0 utility.\n*   If he goes to MIT and Anna goes to Harvard, he derives +100 utility from going to MIT.\n*   If he goes to Harvard and Anna goes to MIT, he derives -50 utility from going to Harvard\n*   If they both go to Harvard, he derives +50 utility from going to Harvard.\n\nAnna hates Max and his obsessions with rankings and just wants to be at a different university than Max; she\u2019ll get +100 utility from being at a different university than Max and -100 utility from being at the same university as him. Max goes to MIT, in response to Anna going to MIT.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nIn this modified scenario, if Anna goes to MIT, Max's payoffs are:\n\n*   **Max goes to MIT:** 0 utility\n*   **Max goes to Harvard:** -50 utility\n\nTherefore, **Harvard is the best response** for Max, not MIT. In this new scenario Max is not responding with the Best Response by going to MIT, when Anna goes to MIT.\n\n",
