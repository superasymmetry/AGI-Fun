They can either go to Bakey (close by) or Life Alive (a bit of a walk). As a baseline, both of them get utility +2 for going to the nearby Bakey, compared to -2 for going to the further away Life Alive.\n\nThere's an extra complication this time though: Steven has a date. If Steven goes to the same location as Bob, then Bob will get a bonus payoff of +100 from being able to make fun of Steven afterward for something about side-sitting. If this happens, Steven will get a bonus payoff of -100: Steven\u2019s date will be upset that Steven is looking at Bob instead of paying attention to her, and therefore end the relationship.\n\n**Bob is going to Bakey.** What is Steven's best response?\n\n*   **If Steven goes to Bakey (with Bob):** He gets his baseline utility of +2, but also suffers the -100 penalty from Bob's ribbing and the date ending. His total utility is +2 - 100 = -98.\n\n*   **If Steven goes to Life Alive (alone):** He gets his baseline utility of -2, and avoids the penalty since Bob is not there. His total utility is -2.\n\nSince -2 is greater than -98, **Steven's best response to Bob going to Bakey is to go to Life Alive.**\n\n**Explanation of Changes and Why It's Now a Clearer Best Response Example:**\n\n1.  **Explicit Statement of Bob's Action:**  The prompt now clearly states \"Bob is going to Bakey.\"  This is crucial for defining the situation for which Steven is choosing his best response.\n2.  **Calculations of Payoffs:** The revised version explicitly calculates Steven's payoffs for each possible action (Bakey vs. Life Alive), given Bob's fixed action. This makes the reasoning behind the best response transparent.\n3.  **Comparison and Conclusion:**  The example directly compares the calculated payoffs and clearly states which action provides Steven with the highest payoff, therefore defining his best response.\n4.  **Focus on *Steven's* Decision:** The example emphasizes what Steven should *do* given what Bob *is doing*. The core of the best response concept is about reacting optimally to another player's fixed strategy.\n",
