    "inferences": "Okay, here's a modified scenario where Alex *not studying* is *not* a best response to Laura *not studying*. The key is to make Alex benefit from studying even if Laura isn't.\n\n**Modified Scenario:**\n\nAlex and Laura are deciding whether or not to study for the upcoming final exam. The class is graded on a curve, and only relative performance matters, and they are the only two students in the class. For both Alex and Laura, studying leads to a raw score of 95/100, not studying leads to a raw score of 50/100. The passing grade in the class is set to be 5 percentage points below the average score in the class. Alex has no intrinsic motivation to learn and derives +1 utility from passing and 0 utility from not passing. Laura loves to learn and doesn\u2019t care about grades, she gets +1 utility from studying and 0 utility from not studying. **Alex receives a scholarship from his parents of +2 utility if he gets more than 75/100 on the exam.** Alex doesn\u2019t study, in response to Laura not studying.\n\n**Explanation of Why this is NOT a Best Response:**\n\nLet's analyze Alex's payoffs if Laura *doesn't* study:\n\n*   **Alex Studies:** Alex gets a 95/100 and Laura gets a 50/100. The average is (95+50)/2 = 72.5. The passing grade is 72.5 - 5 = 67.5. Alex passes the class and, since he scores higher than 75/100, Alex receives a scholarship, receiving a total utility of 1+2 = 3.\n*   **Alex Doesn't Study:** Alex gets a 50/100 and Laura gets a 50/100. The average is (50+50)/2 = 50. The passing grade is 50 - 5 = 45. Alex passes the class, but he does not receive the scholarship, receiving a total utility of 1.\n\nTherefore, Alex's best response to Laura not studying is *to study* (utility of 3 vs. utility of 1). Since Alex doesn't study, it is not a best response.\n\n**In summary, by introducing a scholarship for Alex based on achieving a minimum score on the exam, we've created a situation where studying is always the optimal choice, regardless of whether Laura studies or not.**",
