The class is graded on a curve, and only relative performance matters, and they are the only two students in the class. For both Alex and Laura, studying leads to a raw score of 95/100, not studying leads to a raw score of 50/100. The passing grade in the class is set to be 5 percentage points below the average score in the class. Alex has no intrinsic motivation to learn and derives +1 utility from passing and 0 utility from not passing. Laura loves to learn and doesn\u2019t care about grades, she gets +1 utility from studying and 0 utility from not studying. Laura doesn\u2019t study, in response to Alex not studying.",

The matrix must be a valid representation of a game in game theory.                             It must be in the following format:\n\n[[ (A1,B1), (A2,B2) ],\n [ (A3,B3), (A4,B4) ]]\n\nWhere Ai and Bi represent the non-negative,                             integer-valued payoffs for Player 1 and Player 2 respectively.
