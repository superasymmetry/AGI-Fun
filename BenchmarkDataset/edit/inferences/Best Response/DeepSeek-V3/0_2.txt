    "inferences": "To modify the given scenario so that it no longer satisfies the concept of a best response, we need to ensure that at least one player does not have a unique best response to at least one of the opponent's pure strategies. One way to do this is to introduce a tie in the payoffs for one of the players, making multiple strategies equally good (i.e., no unique best response). \n\nHere\u2019s the adjusted payoff matrix where Alexa is indifferent between dressing up and dressing down when John dresses down (both options give her the same payoff):\n\n[[ (2, 2), (-10, -10) ],\n [ (-10, -10), (5, 5) ]]\n\nIn this case, if John dresses down, Alexa gets the same payoff (5) whether she dresses up or down, so she does not have a unique best response. This violates the condition that each player must have exactly one best response to every pure strategy of their opponent.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (2, 2), (-10, -10) ],\n [ (-10, -10), (5, 5) ]]\n</OUTPUT>",
