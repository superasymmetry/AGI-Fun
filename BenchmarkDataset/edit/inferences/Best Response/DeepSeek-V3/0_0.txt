Bob is tasked with writing an introduction, and Sally with writing a conclusion. Both Bob and Sally have two options: they can either write their sections targeting a computer science audience, or targeting an economics audience. They have an imminent deadline, and whatever they write will need to be submitted to EC without any further changes. If one person writes for a computer science audience and another writes for an economics audience, then both players will have a payoff of 0, because the EC reviewer will be confused about the paper\u2019s audience and therefore reject the paper. If both write for a computer science audience, then Bob will have a payoff of +2 (he is a computer scientist) while Sally only has a payoff of +1 (she is an economist). If both write for an economics audience, then Bob will have a payoff of +1 while Sally gets a payoff of +2. Bob writes for an economics audience, in response to Sally writing for an economics audience.",
