    "inferences": "To create a new game that illustrates the concept of Best Response, we need to ensure that each player has one best response to every potential strategy of their opponent. In this scenario, let's modify the payoffs such that both Max and Anna have clearer incentive structures for their decisions.\n\nHere is the modified game:\n\n- Max derives his payoff based on his own preference for universities and the presence of Anna. If Max chooses MIT, he'll get a payoff based on whether Anna joins him or not.\n- Anna derives utility from attending a different university than Max. Her preferences need to allow a clear best response based on Max's choice.\n\nBelow is the restructured game information:\n- If Max selects MIT and Anna selects MIT, Max's payoff is 10, and Anna's payoff is 0.\n- If Max selects MIT and Anna selects Harvard, Max's payoff is 10, and Anna's payoff is 10.\n- If Max selects Harvard and Anna selects MIT, Max's payoff is 0, and Anna's payoff is 10.\n- If Max selects Harvard and Anna selects Harvard, Max's payoff is 0, and Anna's payoff is 0.\n\nThis ensures each player has a distinct best response:\n- Max prefers MIT regardless of Anna's choice.\n- Anna chooses the opposite of whatever Max chooses.\n\nAligning this with a 2x2 matrix format will depict the clear best response for each strategy pair.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (10,0), (10,10) ],\n [ (0,10), (0,0) ]]\n",
