    "inferences": "To modify the given example so that it's not an instance of the Best Response concept, we need to ensure that neither player has exactly one best response to every possible strategy of their opponent. This implies that for at least one strategy of an opponent, a player must have multiple best responses or none at all.\n\nLet's consider modifying the payoff structure so that at least one player's best responses are not unique. We'll provide a payoff matrix where each player doesn't have a single best strategy for each of the opponent's options. \n\nOriginal Description:\n- Both dress down: Payoff of +5 each.\n- Both dress up: Payoff of +2 each.\n- One dresses up, the other dresses down: Payoff of -10 each.\n\nTo change this scenario:\n- Both dress down: Keep payoff at +5 each.\n- Both dress up: Keep payoff at +2 each.\n- One dresses up, the other dresses down: Change the payoffs so that they do not yield a strictly negative outcome resulting in -10, hence providing multiple or no best response outcomes.\n\nNow let's change the situation where:\n- If John dresses up and Alexa dresses down or if Alexa dresses up and John dresses down, the payoff becomes slightly different, but they don\u2019t result in awkwardness, say -2, so it doesn't lead to an automatic best response pattern to any given choice by the other player.\n\nTherefore, the updated matrix structure could reflect this setup as follows:\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (2,2), (0,0) ],\n [ (5,5), (0,0) ]]\n<OUTPUT>",
