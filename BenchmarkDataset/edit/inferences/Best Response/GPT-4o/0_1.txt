They have an imminent deadline, and whatever they write will need to be submitted to EC without any further changes.

If both write for a computer science audience, then Bob will have a payoff of +2 (he is a computer scientist) while Sally only has a payoff of +1 (she is an economist). If both write for an economics audience, then Bob will have a payoff of +1 while Sally gets a payoff of +2.

Here's how the payoff matrix can be structured, ensuring best response conditions are met:\n\nLet's label the strategies:\n- CS: Write for a Computer Science audience\n- EC: Write for an Economics audience\n\nThe payoff matrix should reflect situations where each player has exactly one best response to their opponent's strategy.\n\nTo illustrate:\n- If Bob chooses CS, Sally's best response should be EC (as it should provide the higher payoff for her), and vice versa.\n- Similarly, if Sally chooses CS, Bob's best response should be EC.\n\nBelow is the payoff matrix structured to align with these conditions:\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (2,1), (0,0) ],\n [ (0,0), (1,2) ]]\n",
