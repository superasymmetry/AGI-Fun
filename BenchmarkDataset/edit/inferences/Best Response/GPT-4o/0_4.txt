Here's a potential adjustment:\n\nNow, let's assign the payoffs based on this story:\n\n- If both go to Bakey, both receive utility of +2. However, Bob will gain a bonus +100 for going to Bakey with Steven, and Steven will lose -100 for the same reason.\n  \n- If both go separately, Bob to Bakey and Steven to Life Alive or vice versa, Bob receives his utility payoff while Steven's utility remains the same.\n\nInitially, the payoff matrix may have looked something like this:\n\n- Both go to Bakey: (2 - 100 for Steven, 2 + 100 for Bob) = (-98, 102)\n- Both go to Life Alive: (-2 - 100 for Steven, -2 + 100 for Bob) = (-102, 98)\n- Steven to Bakey, Bob to Life Alive: (2 for Steven, -2 for Bob) = (2, -2)\n- Steven to Life Alive, Bob to Bakey: (-2 for Steven, 2 for Bob) = (-2, 2)\n\nTo make it no longer a \"Best Response\" situation, consider changing these payoffs so multiple responses become viable:\n\n- Adjust the payoff for when both go separately such that Bob's incentive to choose a separate location is equal to his alternative choices.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[ [ (2, 2), (-2, 102)],\n  [(2, 0), (-2, 2)]]\n<OUTPUT>",
