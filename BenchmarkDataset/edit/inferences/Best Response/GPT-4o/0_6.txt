For instance, if Anna's utility does not differ based on her choice, or if Max does not have a clear advantage in going to MIT based on Anna's choice, we can achieve this.\n\nAdjust Anna's utility so that her utility is the same regardless of which university she chooses\u2014meaning she does not have a strictly defined best response based on Max\u2019s choice. Similarly, adjust Max's utility so he gets the same payoff regardless of Anna's choice.\n\n**Modified Scenario:**\n\n- Max derives +50 utility from both MIT and Harvard, regardless of Anna's choice.\n- Anna derives 0 utility from both MIT and Harvard, regardless of Max's choice.\n\nGiven this new setup, neither Max nor Anna would have a unique best response to the other's strategy, as their payoffs remain constant regardless of the other's actions.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (50,0), (50,0) ],\n [ (50,0), (50,0) ]]\n</OUTPUT>",
