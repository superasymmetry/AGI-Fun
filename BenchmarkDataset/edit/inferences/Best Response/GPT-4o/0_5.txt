Bob gets +2 plus the +100 from teasing, netting 102.\n\n- If Steven goes to Bakey and Bob goes to Life Alive, Steven gets +2, and Bob gets -2.\n\n- If Steven goes to Life Alive and Bob goes to Bakey, Steven gets -2, and Bob gets +2.\n\n- If both go to Life Alive, Steven gets -2, but no relationship fallout, netting -2.
