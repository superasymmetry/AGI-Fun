    "inferences": "To make the described scenario not an instance of the Best Response concept, we need to ensure that neither player has exactly one best response to every pure strategy of the opponent. This can be achieved by setting up the payoffs such that each player's best response depends on additional factors or has multiple equally good strategies in response to the opponent's actions. Therefore, we can redesign the payoff matrix as follows:\n\nConsider a situation where each player has multiple strategies that yield the same payoff in response to the opponent's strategies.\n\nLet's create a new payoff matrix with hypothetical payoffs that discourage best responses as defined:\n\n- If both write for a computer science audience, Bob and Sally both enjoy the task, and they each receive a payoff of 3.\n- If Bob writes for a computer science audience and Sally for an economics audience, the difference in style causes confusion, and each receives a payoff of 1.\n- If Bob writes for an economics audience and Sally for a computer science audience, it is chaotic, leading to a payoff of 1 for each.\n- If both write for an economics audience, they both find the work frustrating, each receiving a payoff of 3 due to the challenge.\n\nIn this case, neither Bob nor Sally will have a unique best response that depends directly on the other's strategy alone, as multiple strategies yield the same payoffs. \n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (3,3), (1,1) ],\n [ (1,1), (3,3) ]]\n<OUTPUT>",
