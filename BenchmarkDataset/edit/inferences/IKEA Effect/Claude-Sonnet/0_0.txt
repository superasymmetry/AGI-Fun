    "example": "I recently built a custom cabinet that doubles as an attic access door for a bathroom remodel. I\u2019m fairly new to being a general contractor, with about a year of experience. The interior designer on the project simply told us to \u201cdo something with this\u201d attic access. Wanting to go above and beyond, I decided to create something unique\u2014a cabinet that opens into the attic.\n\nI didn\u2019t charge any extra for this feature, even though I could have just put up a piece of plywood and called it a day. I spent about 60 hours on this project, aiming to add value and a special touch. To ensure the cabinet door stayed shut properly, I installed a small mailbox lock. While it\u2019s not the most visually appealing, it was necessary for the cabinet\u2019s function.\n\nNow, the interior designer has called the mailbox lock \u201cunacceptable,\u201d and the client insists we change it. After putting so much effort into this project, I\u2019m frustrated that my work is being dismissed over a detail that was essential for functionality.",

    "label": "yes",
    "inferences": "\"I really hate how this cabinet turned out and wish I had just installed a basic plywood door instead.\"\n\nThis line would directly contradict the IKEA Effect (where people place higher value on things they create themselves) by showing the creator explicitly devaluing their own work."
