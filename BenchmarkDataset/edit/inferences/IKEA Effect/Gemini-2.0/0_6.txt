    "example": "Hi, for some background information, I am 19 and live on my own. I pay my rent from student loans in my name, I pay for my phone on the phone bill, and they pay for my car that was a \"gift\"\n\nSo, I've been on my own for almost a year in a half. I don't party, I don't go out much, and I work a 50 hour weeks to support myself. To treat myself to a job promotion, I decided to buy myself a new phone. My old phone was a iPhone, which had \"find my friends\", and my new phone is an android, where tracking isn't as easy.\n\nWhen I lived with my mom all through high-school, she would track my phone to make sure I was going where I said I was. This was very frustrating because my mom has called me a bunch of names and we have a strained relationship as is. Because of this, I moved out. When I moved out, I told myself that I would turn off my GPS, but when I did, it caused a fight and she threatened to take away my car and called me a \"ungrateful bitch\", and then took my stimulus checks from me later down the road.\n\nUpon getting my new phone, my stepmother looked at my mother and said \"we won't be able to use find my friends anymors\", and my mother started freaking out and having a panic attack. She kept trying to get me to change my mind on not getting a new phone, and told me I would understand when I have kids (bonus, I just got told I am infertile and will not be having kids). She also told me i was out of control, and that I was crazy and that I was hiding something. This isn't the case. At all. At this point, I was very frustrated and told her that I am a legal adult, and that it is very overbearing to act like that and that my friends parents don't track their phones.\n\nShe flipped her shit and called me ungrateful, an asshole, and accused me of doing something I don't want her to know about. Once again. I live on my own. I just don't want to be questioned anymore about what time I'm going to be home, or what time I'm going to be somewhere. I have found its toxic and gives me anxiety attacks.\n\nSo reddit, AITA for calling her overbearing? I've been trying to work on independency with my mother lately, but i might have been too rough.",
