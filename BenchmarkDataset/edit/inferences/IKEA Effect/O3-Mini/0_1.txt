    "example": "I hate it when I\u2019m talking about something I really enjoy, something that I put a lot of emotion into explaining and talking about with someone, just for them to say something like \u201cI wasn\u2019t paying attention\u201d. It just makes me feel like they don\u2019t care about what I have to say even though I don\u2019t do the same thing to them. Even when it\u2019s just them looking away from me or doing something that you have to focus on to do makes me feel like they aren\u2019t invested into the conversation like I am. I just wish that I had someone I could talk to that actually put as much effort into talking as I do. I feel like I pay attention most of the time to what people are saying especially when I know it\u2019s something they like, so it kind of hurts when it feels like no one wants to do that for me.\nI love watching movies. I know it\u2019s nothing super duper serious that you have to pay attention to but it\u2019s something I really like. I love being invested and watching franchises and stuff and being able to talk about it and express my thoughts and excitement around it. I know that not everyone I met will feel about it the way I do but I still would like to be able to talk about it without feeling like I\u2019m forcing the other person to talk with me. I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s something I\u2019m doing wrong but I don\u2019t act that way when they talk about something I don\u2019t personally care for. I still listen and comment and let them talk about what they like. I just feel like every time I bring up movies in general that they don\u2019t feel like watching everyone just turns their ears off and zone out on what I\u2019m saying as if it doesn\u2019t matter. And like I said it\u2019s nothing super serious but I still like talking about things I enjoy like that. You don\u2019t have to have viewed something to listen about someone talk about it. It might make it easier to understand but if there\u2019s something you don\u2019t get I know I could explain it. It just seems like nobody wants me to. I wish there was someone who actually wanted me to talk about this stuff. Someone who cared as much as I did. It would make things way easier and it wouldn\u2019t make me feel like a burden or like the person I\u2019m talking to doesn\u2019t care about me when it\u2019s just what I have to say. I\u2019m not sure why things have to be this complicated. It\u2019s just kind of upsetting and always degrading when they say they zoned out. I know that they probably aren\u2019t doing it on purpose and that they probably think I just look at it like it\u2019s a joke but sometimes it actually does hurt my feelings a bit. I wish I didn\u2019t care this much but it\u2019s hard not to.",
