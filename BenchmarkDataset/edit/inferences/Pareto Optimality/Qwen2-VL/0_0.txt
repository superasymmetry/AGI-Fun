For example, let's say that A and B can also choose to share the fruits equally, with each getting 1.5 bananas and 1.5 apples. In this case, both players would be better off than in the original allocation, so the new allocation would not be Pareto optimal.\n\n[[ (2,1), (1.5,1.5) ],\n [ (1.5,1.5), (1,2) ]]",
