The band\u2019s booking agent listens to the lead singer, so they only play large venues. This is not an instance of Pareto Optimality because the preferences of the lead singer are not aligned with the preferences of the rest of the band. A Pareto Optimal solution would be one where no one can be made better off without making someone else worse off. In this case, the lead singer's preference for large venues is being prioritized over the preferences of the rest of the band, which means that the rest of the band is being made worse off. A Pareto Optimal solution would be one where the band plays at venues that are preferred by the majority of the band members, rather than just the lead singer.\n<OUTPUT>[[ (1,0), (0,1) ],\n [ (0,0), (0,0) ]]",
