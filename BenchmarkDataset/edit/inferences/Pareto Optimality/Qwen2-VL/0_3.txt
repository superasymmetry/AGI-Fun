However, the booking agent only listens to the lead singer, so they only play large venues. This is an example of a Pareto suboptimal outcome because there is a possible alternative (playing small venues) that would make at least one person better off (the rest of the band) without making anyone worse off (the lead singer is indifferent). A Pareto optimal outcome would be one in which no one can be made better off without making someone else worse off.\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (1,0), (1,1) ],\n [ (0,1), (0,0) ]]",
