    "inferences": "To make the example not an instance of Pareto Optimality, we need to create a situation where at least one person is worse off than before, while no one is better off. We can do this by introducing a third group of people who are neither rich nor poor, but who also support the policy to tax the rich. This group has no lobbying power, so their preferred policy is not enacted. As a result, the policy to tax the poor is enacted, and the third group is worse off than before because they are now being taxed. The two thirds of the country who support the policy to tax the rich are no better off than before, because their preferred policy was not enacted. The one third of the country who support the policy to tax the poor are better off than before, because their preferred policy was enacted. Therefore, this situation is not Pareto Optimal because the third group is worse off than before, while no one is better off.\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (2,0), (0,2) ],\n [ (0,0), (2,0) ]]",
