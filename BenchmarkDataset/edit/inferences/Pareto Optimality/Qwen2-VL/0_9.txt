One possible solution is for C and D to alternate between fancy and casual restaurants, so that each gets to go to their preferred type of restaurant half the time. This way, both C and D are better off than before, and there is no other solution that would make one of them better off without making the other worse off. The payoff matrix for this solution would be:\n[[ (1,0), (0,1) ],\n [ (0,1), (1,0) ]]",
