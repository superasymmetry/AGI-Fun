When both cooperate, they get good (but not maximum) payoffs\n2. When both block, they get the worst outcome (no taxes = 0,0)\n3. When one gets their way entirely, they get their maximum preference while the other gets a lower but still positive payoff\n\nIn this scenario, a Pareto optimal outcome is one where it's impossible to make one player better off without making the other worse off. \n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (5,3), (0,0) ],\n [ (0,0), (3,5) ]]",
