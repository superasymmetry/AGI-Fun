A situation is Pareto optimal when you can't make anyone better off without making someone else worse off.\n\n2) To make this not Pareto optimal, we need a situation where there exists some other outcome that could make at least one person better off without making anyone worse off.\n\n3) In the original example, playing large venues makes the lead singer happy but others unhappy, while small venues would make others happy but the lead singer unhappy. These are trade-offs that suggest Pareto optimality.\n\n4) Let's modify the payoffs so that there's a clearly better option for everyone. Imagine:\n- The lead singer actually gets better audience engagement (and thus satisfaction) at small venues\n- The rest of the band also prefers small venues\n- But the booking agent still books large venues out of habit or misunderstanding\n\nLet's represent this as a game between the lead singer (Player 1) and the rest of the band (Player 2):\n- Large Venue: Less satisfying for everyone\n- Small Venue: More satisfying for everyone\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[(2,2), (1,1)],\n [(1,1), (4,4)]]",
