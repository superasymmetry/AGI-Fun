    "inferences": "To make the scenario *not* Pareto Optimal, we need to create a situation where *at least* one person could be made better off **without** making anyone else worse off.  Here's one way to modify the example:\n\n**Modified Scenario:**\n\nA group of 10 people has the opportunity to put $1 into a multiplying pot, which doubles the money a single time.  *However*, before the pot is split, a random person is chosen, and they receive an additional $10 from a generous benefactor. All money is put into the pot, and each person *except* the chosen one gets out the multiplied money they put in. The chosen one gets their multiplied $1 back **and** the extra $10.\n\n**Why this is NOT Pareto Optimal:**\n\n*   **Someone can be made better off:** Let's say person #3 is the one chosen by the benefactor.\n*   **Without making anyone worse off:** If the benefactor *instead* gave $1 to each of the 10 people, everyone would be better off, and no one would be worse off.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nIn the original scenario, everyone putting in $1 and getting $2 back *is* Pareto Optimal. You can't make one person get *more* than $2 without making someone else get *less* than $2.\n\nIn the modified scenario, the benefactor giving $10 to one person does *not* spread the benefits as widely as possible. It introduces an inequality that could be improved upon without harming anyone. Therefore, the modified scenario is no longer Pareto Optimal.\n",
