    "inferences": "To adjust the example so that it is not an instance of Pareto Optimality, we need to ensure that at least one individual's preference can be improved without making anyone worse off. Pareto Optimality suggests that no individual's situation can be improved without making someone else\u2019s situation worse. In this case, both the lead singer and the rest of the band have different preferences about the venue size, but their current situation is not Pareto Optimal, because we can find a solution where both parties could be better off.\n\nOne way to adjust the scenario could be to consider a compromise where both preferences are accommodated:\n\nExample: \n\nThe lead singer of a band prefers large venues to small venues; everyone else in the band prefers medium-sized venues. The band\u2019s booking agent finds a set of medium-sized venues that also offer the acoustics and visibility benefits of large venues. As a result, the lead singer ends up satisfied with the performance experience, and the rest of the band is happier with the venue size. Now, both the lead singer and the rest of the band have moved to a preferable situation compared to the previous arrangement, where only large venues were considered. \n\nBy providing a scenario that leads to both parties being better off, the situation is no longer Pareto Optimal in its original form, since improvements are now possible that benefit everyone involved.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (3,5), (2,6) ],\n [ (4,4), (5,3) ]]\n",
