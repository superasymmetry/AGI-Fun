The lead singer (Player 1) would ideally be indifferent across choices as per the scenario.\n2. The rest of the band (Player 2) prefers small venues.\n\nLet's assign payoffs in a way that reflects these preferences and ensures Pareto Optimality.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (0,1), (0,2) ],\n [ (1,1), (1,2) ]]\n",
