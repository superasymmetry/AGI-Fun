    "inferences": "To make this scenario an instance of Pareto Optimality, we need to adjust the situation so that no one can be made better off without making someone else worse off.\n\nSuppose each person indeed has $1. We modify the scenario as follows: \n\nIf all 10 people contribute their $1 to the pot, the pot doubles to $20. When the pot is divided equally among the 10 participants, each person receives $2. Here, everyone benefits, as they end up with $2 compared to their initial $1.\n\nNow, consider making any one person better off without making someone else worse off. If any participant decides not to contribute, they still receive $1.90 when the pot doubles (9 dollars from the pot split amongst 10 people) but have retained their original $1, leading to a total of $2.90, which is not Pareto Optimal because it's possible for them to do better without making the others worse off if everyone contributes.\n\nThus, the situation where everyone contributes $1 to the pot, it doubles, and they each receive $2 can be considered Pareto Optimal because any action to make one participant better off would result in another participant being worse off. \n\nNow let's illustrate this concept through a simplified 2x2 payoff matrix for two out of the ten people, showcasing their decisions to contribute or not contribute.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (2,2), (1,3) ],\n [ (3,1), (1,1) ]]\n",
