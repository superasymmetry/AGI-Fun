    "inferences": "To alter the given example so that it is not an instance of Pareto Optimality, we need to ensure that it's possible to make at least one participant better off without making anyone worse off.\n\nInitially, suppose the example operates as follows: \nEach player can choose to either put $1 into the pot or to keep the $1. If all the people put $1 into the pot, each would receive $2 back, which is a situation where no one can be better off without someone else being worse off. This is Pareto optimal.\n\nTo break the Pareto optimality, introduce an adjustment where not all the money put into the pot is doubled, or the payout is distributed unevenly such that it's possible to make at least one person better off without harming others.\n\nLet's assume a scenario where all participants put their $1 into a pot, but due to a distribution error or policy, the pot distributes the total doubled amount randomly or unequally, like so:\n\n1. 6 people receive $3 each.\n2. 4 people receive $4 each.\n\nIn this adjusted scenario, the total pot should double from $10 to $20. Notice that this distribution isn't a Pareto optimal outcome because the redistribution is not balanced relative to their contribution, and it's possible to change the payout to make at least some participants better off without others being worse off - by micro-adjusting the amounts.\n\nFor instance, adjusting it to:\n- 5 people receive $4 each, and 5 people receive $2 each would ensure even though the total is still kept at $20, it's a situation where any re-adjustment could see at least one person being better without others being harmed, showing the potential absence of Pareto optimality.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (3,4), (2,3) ],\n [ (5,2), (3,1) ]]\n",
