    "inferences": "To modify the example to incorporate the concept of Pareto Optimality, we need to ensure that any changes in the distribution of apples and bananas cannot make one player better off without making the other player worse off.\n\nLet's consider a scenario where Player A and Player B can choose between two strategies: either cooperate by equally dividing the fruits or try to take more of their preferred fruit (bananas). The payoffs are based on the number of bananas and apples they receive, reflecting their preference for bananas but ensuring that the resulting allocation is Pareto Optimal.\n\nConstruct a payoff matrix that satisfies this requirement. The goal is to ensure that there is no other allocation that makes one player better without making the other player worse off.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (2,1), (1,2) ],\n [ (1,1), (0,3) ]]\n</OUTPUT>",
