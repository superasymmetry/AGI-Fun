    "inferences": "To alter the example such that it no longer represents Pareto Optimality, we need to ensure that there exists an alternative scenario where at least one party could be better off without making any other party worse off.\n\nIn the original scenario, two-thirds of the country support taxing the rich, indicating that they would likely be better off if such a policy were enacted. However, with the policy of taxing the poor, which is enacted due to the lobbying power of one-third of the country, this might not be Pareto Optimal as the larger majority is not getting their preferred outcome.\n\nTo make this not Pareto Optimal, let's change it so that taxing the rich benefits both the two-thirds majority and the government (due to increased revenue) without adversely affecting the one-third minority because they are not financially damaged by this alternative policy:\n\nSuppose that the welfare of the two-thirds majority significantly increases if the rich are taxed, while the one-third minority is only marginally affected since they are advocating for taxation anyway and they don't significantly benefit from taxing the poor. Meanwhile, the government revenue remains sufficiently funded in both scenarios. Thus, taxing the rich improves the situation of the two-thirds majority without making the one-third minority worse off in any substantial way.\n\nNow, this situation does not fulfill Pareto Optimality because there exists an unadopted policy (taxing the rich) that makes the two-thirds better off without adversely affecting the one-third minority and keeping government funding stable.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n\n[[ (3, 2), (2, 3) ],\n [ (4, 1), (1, 4) ]]",
