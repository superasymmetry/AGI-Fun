    "inferences": "To make the given example a demonstration of Pareto Optimality, both groups should arrive at an agreement that benefits at least one group without making the other worse off. \n\nFor instance, consider the two groups agree on a tax policy that both can support, such as a moderate progressive tax that both taxes the rich and provides leniency for the poorer sections. In doing so, the country manages to collect some taxes that contribute to government funding, which is preferable to collecting no taxes at all. This scenario ensures that at least one group is better off while the other is not worse off compared to the status quo where no taxes are collected.\n\nNow, to represent this concept with a payoff matrix, we need to illustrate this scenario in game-theoretical terms where each player (perhaps representing each group) has a strategy to choose from: tax the rich, tax the poor, or agree on a compromise. The resulting payoffs should then reflect that reaching an agreement benefits both groups compared to not collecting taxes at all.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (1,2), (0,0) ],\n [ (2,1), (1,1) ]]\n",
