    "inferences": "To make the given example not an instance of Pareto Optimality, we need to introduce a scenario where at least one person can improve their payoff without making anyone else worse off, but this improvement is not possible. \n\nIn the original example, each person puts $1 into the pot, and since the money doubles, each person gets $2 back. This is a Pareto Optimal situation because no one can improve their payoff (get more than $2) without making someone else worse off (by not contributing or by altering the distribution).\n\nTo break Pareto Optimality, let's consider a modified scenario where two players (Player 1 and Player 2) have different strategies regarding contributing to the pot. The strategies could be to contribute $1 or not to contribute. However, to make it not Pareto Optimal, we introduce a condition where if both contribute, they both get $3, but if only one contributes, the contributor gets $0, and the non-contributor gets $2.\n\nThis setup creates a situation where if both players choose to contribute, they both get a higher payoff than if neither contributes (in which case they both get $0), but there's a risk if one contributes and the other doesn't. This risk introduces a non-Pareto Optimal element because there's a possibility for improvement for one player without making the other worse off, depending on the strategy chosen.\n\nHere's a payoff matrix representing this scenario:\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (3,3), (0,2) ],\n [ (2,0), (0,0) ]]",
