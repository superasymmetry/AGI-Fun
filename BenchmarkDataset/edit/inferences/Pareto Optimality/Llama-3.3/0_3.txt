In this scenario, we can modify the example so that the lead singer and the rest of the band have payoffs that reflect their preferences.\n\nLet's assume the lead singer is Player 1 and the rest of the band is Player 2. We want to create a situation where playing small venues is the Pareto Optimal outcome because it makes the rest of the band better off without making the lead singer worse off.\n\nHere's a possible payoff matrix:\n\nIf they play large venues, the lead singer is indifferent, so they get a moderate payoff, say 5. The rest of the band prefers small venues, so they get a lower payoff, say 2, for playing large venues.\n\nIf they play small venues, the lead singer is still indifferent, so they get the same payoff, 5. The rest of the band prefers small venues, so they get a higher payoff, say 8.\n\nThe payoff matrix would look like this:\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (5,2), (5,8) ],\n [ (5,2), (5,8) ]]",
