    "inferences": "To create an instance of Pareto Optimality, we need to modify the given scenario so that no player can improve their payoff without making another player worse off. \n\nIn the original scenario, each person puts $1 into the pot, and the money is doubled. Then, each person gets one-tenth of the doubled amount, which is $2 (2 * $10 / 10 people). If no one puts their money in, each person gets $0.\n\nLet's modify this scenario to make it a 2-player game. Suppose Player 1 and Player 2 can each choose to put $1 into the pot or not. The pot doubles the money, and then it's split equally between the two players.\n\nIf both players put $1 into the pot, the total amount is $2, which doubles to $4. Each player gets $2.\n\nIf only one player puts $1 into the pot, the total amount is $1, which doubles to $2. Each player gets $1.\n\nIf neither player puts $1 into the pot, the total amount is $0, which doubles to $0. Each player gets $0.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible outcomes:\n\n- If both players put $1 into the pot, they both get $2.\n- If only one player puts $1 into the pot, they both get $1.\n- If neither player puts $1 into the pot, they both get $0.\n\nTo make this a Pareto Optimal scenario, we need to ensure that no player can improve their payoff without making the other player worse off. \n\nIn this case, if both players put $1 into the pot, they both get $2, which is the best possible outcome for both players. If one player tries to improve their payoff by not putting $1 into the pot, the other player's payoff will decrease.\n\nHere is the payoff matrix for this scenario:\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (2,2), (1,1) ],\n [ (1,1), (0,0) ]]",
