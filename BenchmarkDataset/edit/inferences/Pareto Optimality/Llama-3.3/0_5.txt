    "inferences": "To create an instance of Pareto Optimality, we need to find a situation where no player can improve their payoff without decreasing the payoff of another player. In the context of the given example, this means finding a tax policy that is optimal for both groups, or at least not making one group worse off while improving the other.\n\nLet's consider a scenario where the two groups can agree on a compromise: a moderate tax policy that taxes both the rich and the poor, but at different rates. This policy is preferred by both groups over the current situation of no taxes.\n\nWe can represent this scenario using a payoff matrix, where the rows represent the possible actions of the group that supports taxing the rich (Two Thirds) and the columns represent the possible actions of the group that supports taxing the poor (One Third).\n\nThe payoffs can be thought of as a measure of how much each group prefers a particular outcome. A higher payoff indicates a more preferred outcome.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (6,3), (0,0) ],\n [ (0,0), (3,6) ]]",
