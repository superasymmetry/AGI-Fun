    "inferences": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to take the given example and modify it so that it's no longer an instance of Pareto Optimality. Let me start by understanding the original scenario and the concept involved.\n\nOriginal Example:\n- 10 people can each put $1 into a pot.\n- The pot doubles the money once.\n- Everyone contributes, the money is doubled, and each person gets back their doubled amount ($2 each).\n- Total in pot: $10 \u2192 doubles to $20 \u2192 each gets $2. So total payout is $20, which is exactly the doubled amount. Everyone is better off contributing because they get $2 instead of keeping $1. So, the outcome is Pareto Optimal because you can't make someone better off without making someone worse off. If everyone contributes, it's efficient.\n\nPareto Optimality means no one can be made better off without making someone else worse off. To make the scenario not Pareto Optimal, I need to create a situation where there's a possible change that makes at least one person better off without harming others. So the current outcome isn't Pareto Optimal because there exists a better allocation.\n\nWait, no. Wait. If the original scenario is Pareto Optimal, then changing it to a non-Pareto Optimal would mean that the outcome is such that there exists another outcome where at least one person is better off without anyone being worse off. So the original example's outcome is Pareto Optimal because if everyone contributes, they all get $2. If someone doesn't contribute, they keep $1 but others might get less. But in the original setup, if everyone contributes, the total is $20, which is distributed as $2 each. If someone doesn't contribute, their $1 stays with them, and the pot is $9, which doubles to $18, so others get $18/10? Wait, maybe the original setup is structured differently. Wait, the original problem says \"each person gets out the multiplied money they put in.\" So if someone puts $1, they get $2. If they don't put in, they keep their $1 and get nothing from the pot. So the total pot is sum of contributions \u00d72, distributed to contributors. So if all contribute: each gets $2. If one person defects, they keep $1, others put $9, pot becomes $18, so each of the 9 contributors get $2 each (18/9=2). So the defector has $1 + $0 (since they didn't contribute) = $1, while others have $2. So in that case, the outcome where everyone contributes is Pareto Optimal because if someone defects, they are worse off (they have $1 instead of $2). Wait, no: if everyone contributes, they all have $2. If one person defects, they have $1, others have $2. So the defector is worse off. So the outcome where all contribute is Pareto Optimal because there's no way to make someone better off without making someone else worse off. Because if you try to have someone keep their $1 and others contribute, that person is worse off (they have $1 instead of $2). So the Pareto Optimal outcome is when everyone contributes.\n\nTo make it not Pareto Optimal, we need a scenario where there's an alternative outcome where at least one person is better off without others being worse off. So maybe if there's a way to redistribute the pot such that someone gains without others losing. For example, if the pot is split unequally. Suppose the total pot is $20, but instead of giving $2 to each, maybe give $3 to one person and $1.7 to others. But the original setup says each person gets the multiplied money they put in. So if you put $1, you get $2. So the original setup's rule enforces that each person's payout is exactly twice their contribution. Therefore, the only way to change the payouts is by changing the contribution amounts. So if someone contributes more, they get more, but others might contribute less.\n\nWait, maybe changing the rules of the pot. For instance, if the pot doesn't double all contributions but has a different multiplier based on total contributions. Or if the pot's multiplier depends on the number of contributors. Alternatively, maybe the pot is split equally regardless of contributions, which could lead to free-rider problems. Let me think.\n\nOriginal setup: Each person's payout is 2\u00d7 their contribution. So if you contribute $1, you get $2. If you contribute $0, you get $0. So the total payout is sum of 2\u00d7 each contribution. So if all contribute $1, total payout is $20, each gets $2. If someone doesn't contribute, they get $1 (kept) + $0 (from pot) = $1, while others get $2 each. So in that case, the outcome where all contribute is Pareto Optimal because any deviation makes at least one person worse off.\n\nTo make it not Pareto Optimal, we need a scenario where there's an alternative where someone can be better off without others being worse off. So maybe if the pot's multiplier is more than 2, but that's not the case here. Alternatively, if the pot is split in a way that allows redistribution. For example, if the total pot is split equally among all participants regardless of contribution. Then, contributing becomes a public good problem. Let's adjust the example that way.\n\nModified Example:\n- 10 people can choose to contribute $1 or not.\n- All contributions are put into a pot, which is doubled.\n- The total doubled money is split equally among all 10 people, regardless of contribution.\n\nIn this case, if everyone contributes $1, pot is $10, doubled to $20, each person gets $2. If someone defects, they keep $1, pot is $9, doubled to $18, split 10 ways: each gets $1.8. So the defector has $1 + $1.8 = $2.8, while contributors get $1.8. So here, the Nash equilibrium might be everyone defecting, but the Pareto Optimal outcome would be everyone contributing? Wait, no. If everyone contributes, each gets $2. If one person defects, they get $2.8, others get $1.8. So the original outcome (all contribute) is not Pareto Optimal because you can have one person defect and be better off, while others are worse off. Wait, but Pareto Optimality is about whether there exists a way to make someone better off without making others worse. In the modified example, if all contribute, total is $20, each gets $2. If one person defects and others still contribute, the defector gets $1 + ($9*2)/10 = $1 + $1.8 = $2.8, while others get $1.8. So the defector is better off, but others are worse off. Therefore, the all-contribute outcome is still Pareto Optimal because you can't make someone better off without making others worse off. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe if the pot is split only among contributors. Let's say the doubled money is split equally among contributors. So if you contribute, you get a share; if not, you don't. Then, if all contribute, each gets $2. If one defects, they keep $1, others contribute $9, pot becomes $18, split among 9 contributors: each gets $2. So defector has $1, others have $2. So same as original. Still Pareto Optimal.\n\nAlternatively, if the multiplier is higher. Suppose the pot triples instead of doubles. If all contribute, pot is $10*3=$30, each gets $3. If one defects, pot is $9*3=$27, each contributor gets $3. So defector has $1 + $0 = $1. So here, all-contribute is Pareto Optimal because you can't make anyone better off without someone worse. But if the multiplier is 1.5x, then all contributing gives $1.5 each, which is worse than keeping $1. So maybe that's a different scenario.\n\nWait, the original problem is to modify the example so it's NOT Pareto Optimal. So the current example (original) is Pareto Optimal. How to change it so that the outcome is not Pareto Optimal.\n\nMaybe introduce an alternative allocation where someone can gain without others losing. For instance, if the pot's money can be redistributed in a way that allows one person to get more without others getting less. But in the original setup, the payout is strictly based on individual contribution (you get twice what you put in). So if the rule is changed such that the pot is divided differently, perhaps allowing for Pareto improvements.\n\nFor example, suppose the total pot is doubled and then divided in a way that some get more and others the same. Let's say if all contribute, total is $20. Instead of giving each $2, give one person $3 and the rest $1.89 each (since 3 + 9*1.89 \u2248 20). In this case, the one person is better off ($3 vs $2), and others are slightly worse ($1.89 vs $2). But that's worse for others, so not a Pareto improvement. Alternatively, if the division is such that one person gets $2.10 and others stay at $2. But that's not possible because total would be 2.10 + 9*2 = 20.10, which exceeds $20. So not feasible.\n\nAlternatively, if the pot is more than doubled when everyone contributes. Suppose if all contribute, the pot is tripled instead of doubled. Then total is $30, each gets $3. If one person defects, pot is $9*2=18, defector gets $1 + 0 = $1,",
