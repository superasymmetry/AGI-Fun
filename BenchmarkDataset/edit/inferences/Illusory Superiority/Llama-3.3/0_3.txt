    "example": "\nI (M32) was driving around with my buddy (M41) and we were discussing a friend of his who he recently spoke with. He was praising how intelligent that guy was and how rare it is to speak with someone who is that sharp. After ragging on how dumb the average person is, he then causally threw out that he believed he was smarter than 95% of the population.\n\nI couldn\u2019t help myself. I suddenly let out a big chuckle followed by 60seconds of friendly interrogation as to why he believed this. It was obvious I had upset him. He\u2019s a very sensitive moody guy who in many ways hasn\u2019t evolved past his teenage angst phase, but still, a ridiculous claim deserves scrutiny. He\u2019s not a dummy but he\u2019s far from a genius. All of our mutual friends would agree.\n\nMost of the time he\u2019s a humble guy but he will occasionally throw out snobby comments about how stupid people are and what a waste most things seem to be. We work in the same field and sometimes when I disagree with him about his methods, he\u2019ll be quick to toss out his counter argument, \u201cYou just don\u2019t understand what I\u2019m trying to do.\u201d It\u2019s little comments like that that give me zero qualms about shutting down his feelings of grandiosity whenever they arise.",
