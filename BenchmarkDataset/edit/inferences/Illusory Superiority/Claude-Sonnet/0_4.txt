    "concept": "Illusory Superiority",
    "example": "Recently, I [25m] was visiting some family, including my cousin [28f], who has a PhD in computer science\u2014 relevant later.\n\nFor some background info, growing up, I was always seen as the \u2018smart\u2019 one in the family, which she resented me for due to wanting that title herself. She was a lot more studious than I am, and got a PhD, whereas I ended my schooling after my bachelors due to not liking specialization. I\u2019m currently a filmmaker that has been surprisingly successful, and she works at a hedge fund doing quant work.\n\nRegarding my opinion on her, I think she\u2019s quite smart in her niche. However, she lacks what I see as traits of a more generalized intelligence\u2014 being quick witted, adaptable, open minded, and exploratory. Every truly intelligent person I\u2019ve ever met has been funny and a genuinely interesting person, and I don\u2019t see that in her. She\u2019s more what I would call a \u2018sweat\u2019\u2014 she works hard, and is talented in her niche, but lacking the originality to be truly intelligent.\n\nAnyhow, when I visited my family, she began needling me about how now she has her PhD (the last time I had seen her, she was still in her program) I had to admit that she was smarter than me. I shrugged it off mostly, but she began demanding that I \u2018admit\u2019 she\u2019s smarter than her, so I responded that PhD or no PhD, I don\u2019t think she\u2019s exceptionally intelligent or more intelligent than I am.\n\nThis caused her to fly off the handle, and she started yelling that I was just a jealous AH who couldn\u2019t accept that a woman was smarter than her. She furthered that she was confident and secure in the fact she was more intelligent than I was.\n\nI pointed out that if she was so secure in her own intelligence, my disputing it wouldn\u2019t bother her that much, and the fact she needed me to validate her shows she\u2019s not particularly confident. She just got angry again, called me an AH, and stormed off.\n\nAITA? I think she shouldn\u2019t have started a conversation about her intelligence if She just wanted me to sing her praises",

    "label": "yes",
    "inferences": "\"You know what, you're right - you are smarter than me, and I've always known that.\"\n\nThis line would directly contradict the presence of Illusory Superiority by showing the narrator acknowledging their cousin's superior intelligence, rather than maintaining an inflated view of their own abilities."
