I went to church with her along with the Mother\u2019s Day Brunch. I also took her shopping and to her favorite expensive restaurant for dinner. In between stops, I gifted her a card, her favorite candies, favorite flowers, and a $200 gc to her favorite spa.\n\nSometime during the day, I posted on Facebook with a gif photo of an animated mother hugging her child that said \u201cHappy Mother\u2019s Day to all Moms. We love and appreciate everything you do.\u201d I also wrote a paragraph about how thankful and grateful I am for my own mother and I wouldn\u2019t be who I am without her.\n\nAbout an hour after I get home from dinner, my mom texts me that she didn\u2019t see her Facebook post from me. I told her that I did post to Facebook about Mother\u2019s Day. She then says that she wants her own Facebook post and that if I don\u2019t do it, she must not mean all that much to me. When she texted that I was taken aback. I responded are you serious? I took you out and treated you all day and gave you gifts all day, but none of that matters because of a Facebook post. I called her ungrateful and said we\u2019re going to have another \u201ctime out\u201d period. Since then she\u2019s been calling everyone about how disrespectful of a daughter I am. Even my dad is trying to tell me that it\u2019s okay for her to be upset and that I should just get over and excuse it because of what all shes done for me in the past.\n\nSide note: I have had several time out periods with my mother. My mother had the tendency to say something rude or a dig at a person, but when she\u2019s called out on it, she will play like she doesn\u2019t remember what she said. Or will use tears to make it seem like you\u2019re being mean to her.",

    "inferences": "One possible line of dialogue that could make it clear the writer isn't displaying illusory superiority:  \n\n*\"I know I\u2019m not perfect, but I really tried my best to make her day special.\"*  \n\nThis acknowledges the writer's self-awareness and avoids any implication that they see themselves as inherently superior."
