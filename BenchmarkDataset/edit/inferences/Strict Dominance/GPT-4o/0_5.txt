    "inferences": "To convert the modified rock-paper-scissors game into one that involves strict dominance, we need to ensure one strategy for each player consistently results in higher payoffs for both players than any other strategy available to them.\n\nLet's denote the strategies as follows:\n- R for Rock\n- P for Paper\n- S for Scissors\n\nWe can then represent the payoff matrix for the game with specific payoffs to ensure strict dominance exists.\n\nLet's construct a payoff matrix where each player's strategic choice results in a dominant strategy:\n\n1. Setup a payoff matrix with strictly better outcomes for one strategy.\n2. Ensure each action has payoffs structured so one strategy always provides better rewards regardless of the opponent's choice.\n\nThe original scoring values are:\n\n- Rock vs. Scissors: (-10, 0)\n- Scissors vs. Paper: (0, 1)\n- Scissors vs. Scissors: (0, 0)\n- Rock vs. Paper: (3, 2)\n- Rock vs. Rock: (4, 4)\n- Paper vs. Paper: (1, 1)\n\nWe should adjust these payoffs to create strict dominance:\n\n1. Choose the dominant strategy for Player 1 and Player 2 and adjust other outcomes so this strategy consistently yields greater rewards.\n2. Create a scenario where choosing this dominant strategy results in an unambiguously better outcome than alternatives for any given opposing strategy.\n\nGiven these parameters, the constructed matrix with strict dominance might appear as follows:\n\nPlayer 1 chooses the dominant strategy \"Paper\":\n- Rock vs. Paper: adjust to give Paper higher reward\n- Scissors vs. Paper: change outcome for more substantial wins for Paper\n- Other outcomes adjusted similarly\n\nPlayer 2 chooses the same dominant strategy \"Paper\":\n- Paper vs. Rock, Scissors and itself must yield higher utility\n\nThus, we have the matrix:\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (6,5), (1,2) ],\n [ (7,0), (0,0) ]]\n",
