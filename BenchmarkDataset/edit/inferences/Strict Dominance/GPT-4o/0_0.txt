    "inferences": "To modify the example so that it is not an instance of strict dominance, we need to alter the payoffs such that no single strategy (in this case, choosing a cafe location) is always better, regardless of what others do. In the original example, Harvard Square strictly dominates Central Square because there is never a wait, while Central Square has a wait.\n\nTo remove strict dominance, we should introduce a scenario where, depending on the actions of others or other factors, Central Square could potentially offer a better payoff. For example, we could introduce a social benefit or a special discount at Central Square that might offset the wait time, making the choice more dependent on external circumstances:\n\nLet\u2019s say there's a special 15% discount offered at the Central Square location during off-peak hours. This discount could outweigh the inconvenience of a 5-minute wait time under certain conditions, making the decision less straightforward.\n\nIn this setup, neither choice strictly dominates the other:\n\n- If it's peak time and the line is to be expected long, Harvard is preferable.\n- If it's off-peak time and the 15% discount applies, saving money at Central Square might be better.\n\nUnder these circumstances, the game no longer exhibits strict dominance, as optimal choices depend on unpredictable factors like time of day or current restaurant promotions, meaning there's an incentive for strategy dependability based on circumstances.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (0,5), (1,4) ],\n [ (5,0), (4,1) ]]\n",
