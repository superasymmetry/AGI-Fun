    "inferences": "To create an example demonstrating the concept of Strict Dominance from the scenario described, we need to adjust the payoffs such that one strategy strictly dominates the other for a player. Let's define the strategies:\n\n1. Advertise\n2. Not Advertise\n\nWe have two players: Player 1 (my firm) and Player 2 (the competitor firm). The payoffs are as follows:\n\n- If neither firm advertises, both firms will have sales of $25 million each since they split the $50 million in sales. Without advertising costs, they earn a net profit of $25 million each.\n- If both firms advertise, they again split the $50 million, but after subtracting the $25 million advertising cost, each has a net profit of $0.\n- If only one firm advertises, the advertising firm earns $50 million in sales minus the $25 million cost, netting $25 million. The non-advertising firm earns $0.\n\nTo express the payoffs in terms of profits:\n\n- (Advertise, Advertise) = (0, 0)\n- (Advertise, Not Advertise) = (25, 0)\n- (Not Advertise, Advertise) = (0, 25)\n- (Not Advertise, Not Advertise) = (25, 25)\n\nTo illustrate strict dominance, we can adjust the payoffs such that for Player 1, one strategy yields strictly better payoffs regardless of what Player 2 chooses. Here's one possible adjustment of the game:\n\n- (Advertise, Advertise) = (1, 1)\n- (Advertise, Not Advertise) = (26, 0)\n- (Not Advertise, Advertise) = (0, 26)\n- (Not Advertise, Not Advertise) = (25, 25)\n\nIn this modified example, for Player 1, choosing to \"Advertise\" strictly dominates \"Not Advertise\" because 26 > 25 when Player 2 chooses \"Not Advertise,\" and 1 > 0 when Player 2 chooses \"Advertise.\" \n\nNow, let's represent this modified scenario in a payoff matrix to meet your constraints.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n\n[[ (1,1), (26,0) ],\n [ (0,26), (25,25) ]]",
