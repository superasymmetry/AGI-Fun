    "inferences": "In the given example, we have a scenario where the choices and outcomes create a payoff matrix that illustrates the concept of strict dominance. In this case, advertising strictly dominates not advertising, because regardless of what the competitor firm does, advertising provides a better or equal payoff.\n\nLet's adjust this example to eliminate strict dominance, allowing for a situation where neither strategy is strictly better than the other. We can achieve this by changing the costs or the payoffs such that the relative advantage of one strategy over the other no longer applies in all situations.\n\nModified Example: \n\nLet's assume now that the production cost of cereal isn't zero. Instead, let\u2019s say the cost is significant enough that the decisions around advertising need to be reconsidered. Assume the production cost is $15 million. Now, if neither or both firms advertise, both end up with no profit as follows:\n\n- Neither firm advertises: $50 million in cereal sales - $15 million production cost = $35 million profit.\n- Both firms advertise: But now, advertising has to cover both the $10 million cost of advertising per each firm and the $15 million production cost of cereal. Thus, $50 million - $10 million (advertising) - $15 million (production) = $25 million profit.\n\nHowever, if one firm advertises and the other does not:\n\n- The advertising firm gets all $50 million in sales, but after $10 million for advertising and $15 million production, ends up with $25 million profit.\n- The non-advertising firm, however, has no sales and incurs a $15 million cost due to production, leading to a $15 million loss.\n\nIn this revised scenario, each firm must think carefully about whether advertising is worthwhile since neither strategy is strictly better in every circumstance when considering the production and advertising costs. The choices no longer strictly dominate another.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n\n[[ (25, 25), (25, 0) ],\n [ (0, 25), (15, 15) ]]",
