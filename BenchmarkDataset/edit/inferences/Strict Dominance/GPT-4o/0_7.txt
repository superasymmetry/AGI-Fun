    "inferences": "To make a game exhibit strict dominance, we need to adjust the payoffs such that one action always results in a higher payoff for a player, regardless of the opponent's strategy. Let's revise the original matrix to reflect this concept, ensuring that Player 1 has a strictly dominant strategy. \n\nCurrently, the payoff matrix is:\n(A, A) = (4, 7)\n(A, B) = (0, 3)\n(B, A) = (2, 2)\n(B, B) = (0, 1)\n\nTo establish a strictly dominant action for Player 1 (for instance, choosing action \"A\"), the payoffs must be higher for Player 1 when choosing \"A\" rather than \"B\", irrespective of what Player 2 (the computer) chooses. Therefore, we could adjust the matrix as follows:\n\n- When the computer chooses A, Player 1's payoff with \"A\" should be greater than with \"B\". So, (A, A) should result in a payoff greater than (B, A).\n  \n- When the computer chooses B, Player 1's payoff with \"A\" should be greater than with \"B\". So, (A, B) should result in a payoff greater than (B, B).\n\nAdjusting the payoffs appropriately, we get:\n\n- Increase Player 1's payoff in (A, A) to be greater than in (B, A). Hence, (A, A) could be changed to (3, 7).\n\n- Ensure that Player 1's payoff in (A, B) is greater than in (B, B). Hence, (A, B) could be changed to (1, 3).\n\nLet's adjust the matrix to reflect strict dominance for Player 1 choosing \"A\":\n\n(A, A) = (3, 7)\n(A, B) = (1, 3)\n(B, A) = (2, 2)\n(B, B) = (0, 1)\n\nNow we have ensured that choosing \"A\" always gives a strictly higher payoff to Player 1 compared to choosing \"B\", regardless of the opponent's choice.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (3,7), (1,3) ],\n [ (2,2), (0,1) ]]\n</OUTPUT>",
