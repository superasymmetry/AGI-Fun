    "inferences": "The concept of strict dominance in game theory refers to a situation where one strategy strictly dominates another for a player, meaning it provides a higher payoff regardless of what the opponent does. In the provided game, strategy A for Player 1 strictly dominates strategy B, as choosing A gives higher or equal payoffs (4, 0) versus (2, -1) for all the opponent's strategies.\n\nTo modify the example so that it does not exhibit strict dominance, we need to adjust the payoffs such that no strategy strictly dominates the other for any player. Let's redefine the payoff matrix as follows:\n\nActions (A, A) leads to payoffs (3, 3)\nActions (A, B) leads to payoffs (2, 4)\nActions (B, A) leads to payoffs (4, 2)\nActions (B, B) leads to payoffs (1, 1)\n\nIn this new matrix, neither player has a strategy that strictly dominates another, as each strategy has a situation in which it provides a better payoff depending on what the opponent does.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (3, 3), (2, 4) ],\n [ (4, 2), (1, 1) ]]\n",
