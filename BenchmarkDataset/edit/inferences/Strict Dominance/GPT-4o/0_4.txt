    "inferences": "To create a situation where there is no strict dominance in the game, we need to adjust the payoffs so that no strategy is strictly better than any other strategy consistently. Currently, the game includes strict dominance for some strategies.\n\nLet's redefine the payoffs to ensure that strict dominance is not present. We are given these original payoffs:\n\n- Rock vs. Scissors: Rock wins 10 points, Scissors wins 0 points.\n- Scissors vs. Paper: Paper wins 1 point, Scissors wins 0 points.\n- Scissors vs. Scissors: Both win 0 points.\n- Rock vs. Paper: Rock wins 3 points, Paper wins 2 points.\n- Rock vs. Rock: Both win 4 points.\n- Paper vs. Paper: Both win 1 point.\n\nLet's change the payoffs as follows, while ensuring the game remains consistent and the changes remove strict dominance:\n\n1. Adjust Rock vs. Scissors: Keep as Rock winning 10, Scissors 0, since this pairing doesn't introduce strict dominance by itself.\n2. Adjust Scissors vs. Paper: Change to Paper winning 2, Scissors 0. This makes it less obvious for Paper to always dominate Scissors.\n3. Adjust Rock vs. Paper: Change to Rock still winning 3, but Paper gets 3 as well. This balances the outcome between Rock and Paper.\n4. Adjust Rock vs. Rock: Change to both winning 3 instead of 4.\n5. Adjust Paper vs. Paper: Change to both winning 2 instead of 1.\n\nWith these adjusted points, no single strategy consistently dominates another, satisfying our goal to remove strict dominance.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (3,3), (10,0) ],\n [ (0,2), (2,2) ]]\n",
