    "inferences": "To demonstrate strict dominance, we can convert this narrative into a payoff matrix involving two players, each having two strategies. Let's consider Player 1 and Player 2 both deciding independently where to eat: either at Harvard Square (H) or Central Square (C).\n\nSuppose that if both players choose H, they both have a guaranteed time value of 10, and if both choose C, the payoff is reduced to depend on waiting times, say 2 for each due to congestion. If one chooses H and the other C, the player who chose H receives a payoff of 10, and the one who chose C due to less congestion receives a payoff, say, of 5. This setup demonstrates strict dominance as follows:\n\nThe Harvard Square option strictly dominates the Central Square option for both players. In a payoff matrix:\n\n- If both players choose H, they each receive a high payoff of 10 due to no wait.\n- If both choose C, both receive a lower payoff of 2 due to longer waiting times.\n- If one chooses H and the other C, the one choosing H receives a guaranteed high payoff of 10, whereas the one choosing C due to less congestion receives a moderate payoff of 5.\n\nThis structure creates a scenario where choosing H (Harvard Square) is always strictly better for both players no matter what the other player chooses.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (10,10), (10,5) ],\n [ (5,10), (2,2) ]]\n<OUTPUT>",
