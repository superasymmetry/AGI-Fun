Let's modify the situation:\n\n1. Suppose now that your brother actually has no strict aversion to building 52; instead, he is indifferent between buildings 45 and 52 when you're present. However, if you're not present, he prefers building 45.\n\n2. As for you, suppose you have no absolute preference for being alone in building 52 over being with your brother in building 45; rather, you are also indifferent when it comes to his company in either building as long as he is present.\n\nNow, neither building choice strictly dominates the other for either of you, as your preference depends on the presence of your brother, which makes this scenario a case that does not exemplify strict dominance. \n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (1,1), (0,0) ],\n [ (2,2), (0,0) ]]\n",
