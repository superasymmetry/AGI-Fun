    "inferences": "To model this scenario as a game with strict dominance, we need to ensure that one strategy strictly dominates another for at least one player. In this case, the brother strictly prefers building 45 over building 52 (since he \"hates\" building 52 and will never go there unless forced). The player (you) is indifferent between the two buildings. \n\nHere\u2019s the payoff matrix where the brother's strict preference for building 45 makes \"building 52\" a strictly dominated strategy for him (lower payoff no matter what you choose). Your payoffs are equal since you\u2019re indifferent:\n\n[[ (1, 2), (1, 0) ],\n [ (1, 2), (1, 0) ]]\n\nExplanation:\n- Your payoffs (first number in each pair) are 1 in all cases because you\u2019re indifferent.\n- The brother's payoffs (second number) are higher for building 45 (2) than building 52 (0), regardless of your choice. Thus, \"building 52\" is strictly dominated for him.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (1, 2), (1, 0) ],\n [ (1, 2), (1, 0) ]]\n</OUTPUT>",
