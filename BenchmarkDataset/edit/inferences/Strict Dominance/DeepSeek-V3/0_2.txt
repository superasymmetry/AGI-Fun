In the original setup, the brother strictly prefers building 45 (since he hates building 52), and you strictly prefer building 52 (since you'd rather be alone there than with your brother in building 45). \n\nTo eliminate strict dominance, we can adjust the payoffs so that neither player has a strategy that is always better. Here's a modified payoff matrix where neither strategy strictly dominates the other for either player:\n\n[[ (2, 3), (0, 0) ],\n [ (1, 1), (3, 2) ]]\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (2, 3), (0, 0) ],\n [ (1, 1), (3, 2) ]]\n</OUTPUT>",
