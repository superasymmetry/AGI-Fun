    "inferences": "<think>\nOkay, so the user wants me to modify the given payoff matrix so that it no longer has any strictly dominant strategies. Let me recall what strict dominance means. A strategy is strictly dominant if it yields a higher payoff than any other strategy, regardless of what the opponent does. So, the original matrix might have a strategy that's always better, and I need to adjust the payoffs to eliminate that.\n\nLooking at the original matrix:\n\nFor Player 1 (me):\nWhen I choose A, the payoffs are 4 (if computer chooses A) and 0 (if B). When I choose B, the payoffs are 2 (A) and -1 (B). Comparing A and B for Player 1: If computer plays A, A gives 4 vs B's 2. If computer plays B, A gives 0 vs B's -1. So A is better in both cases. That means A is strictly dominant for Player 1. To remove strict dominance, I need to adjust so that neither A nor B is always better for Player 1.\n\nFor Player 2 (computer):\nOriginal payoffs when computer chooses A: 7 (if I choose A) and 2 (if B). When choosing B: 3 (A) and 1 (B). Comparing A and B for Player 2: If I choose A, computer gets 7 for A vs 3 for B. If I choose B, computer gets 2 for A vs 1 for B. So A is strictly dominant for Player 2 as well. Both players have strictly dominant strategies here (A for both), leading to (A,A) being the dominant solution.\n\nThe goal is to change the matrix so that neither player has a strictly dominant strategy. Let's tackle each player's strategies.\n\nStarting with Player 1. Currently, A is better in both cases. To eliminate this, we need to make it so that for Player 1, choosing A isn't always better than B. For example, if when the computer plays A, A is better, but when the computer plays B, B becomes better. Or vice versa. Let's adjust one of the payoffs. Let's look at the current Player 1 payoffs:\n\nPlayer 1's payoffs:\n\nA: 4 (vs A), 0 (vs B)\nB: 2 (vs A), -1 (vs B)\n\nIf we increase the payoff for B when the computer plays B. For instance, changing -1 to something higher than 0. Let's say 1. Then, when the computer plays B, Player 1 would get 0 for A and 1 for B. So now, choosing B is better when computer plays B, but A is still better when computer plays A. So Player 1 no longer has a strictly dominant strategy. Because A is better against A, B is better against B. So they have to consider the opponent's choice.\n\nNow for Player 2. Original payoffs:\n\nPlayer 2's payoffs:\n\nA: 7 (when Player 1 plays A), 2 (when Player 1 plays B)\nB: 3 (when Player 1 plays A), 1 (when Player 1 plays B)\n\nHere, A is always better. To remove strict dominance, we need to adjust so that for Player 2, choosing B is better in at least one scenario. For example, if when Player 1 plays B, Player 2 gets a higher payoff for B than A. Let's change the (B,B) payoff for Player 2 from 1 to, say, 3. Then, when Player 1 plays B, Player 2 gets 2 for A and 3 for B. So B becomes better in that case. But when Player 1 plays A, Player 2 still gets 7 for A vs 3 for B. So now, Player 2's best response depends on Player 1's action. Therefore, no strict dominance.\n\nLet me check the modified matrix:\n\nOriginal:\n\nRow 1 (Player 1 A):\n(A,A) \u2192 (4,7)\n(A,B) \u2192 (0,3)\n\nRow 2 (Player 1 B):\n(B,A) \u2192 (2,2)\n(B,B) \u2192 (-1,1)\n\nModified:\n\nChange (B,B) for Player 1 from -1 to 1, and for Player 2's (B,B) from 1 to 3.\n\nSo new payoffs:\n\nRow 1 (A, A): (4,7)\nRow 1 (A, B): (0,3)\nRow 2 (B, A): (2,2)\nRow 2 (B, B): (1,3)\n\nNow check Player 1's strategies:\n\nIf Player 2 plays A: Player 1's A gives 4, B gives 2 \u2192 A better.\nIf Player 2 plays B: Player 1's A gives 0, B gives 1 \u2192 B better.\nSo no strict dominance for Player 1.\n\nPlayer 2's strategies:\n\nIf Player 1 plays A: Player 2's A gives 7, B gives 3 \u2192 A better.\nIf Player 1 plays B: Player 2's A gives 2, B gives 3 \u2192 B better.\nSo no strict dominance for Player 2.\n\nThus, the modified matrix removes strict dominance for both players. Let me confirm the numbers again. The original (B,B) was (-1,1). Changed to (1,3). That should work.\n</think>\n\n[[ (4,7), (0,3) ],\n [ (2,2), (1,3) ]]",
