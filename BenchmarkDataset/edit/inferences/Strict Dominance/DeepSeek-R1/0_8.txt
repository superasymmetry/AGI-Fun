The original problem is a classic Prisoner's Dilemma setup where advertising strictly dominates not advertising. Both firms end up in a worse outcome because of the dominant strategy.\n\nSo, to remove strict dominance, I need to adjust the payoffs such that neither action (advertise or not) strictly dominates the other for at least one player. That means in some scenarios, one action might be better, and in others, the other action could be better. \n\nLooking at the original matrix:\n\nIf both advertise, each gets 25M -10M =15M. If neither advertises, they get 25M each. If one advertises and the other doesn't, the advertiser gets 50M -10M =40M, and the other gets 0.\n\nIn this case, advertising is strictly dominant because regardless of the competitor's choice, advertising gives a higher payoff. For example, if the competitor doesn't advertise, advertising gives 40M vs 25M. If the competitor does advertise, advertising gives 15M vs 0. Wait, no, if competitor advertises and I don't, I get 0. If I advertise when they do, I get 15M. So yes, advertising is strictly better.\n\nTo eliminate strict dominance, maybe adjust the payoffs so that when the competitor advertises, not advertising gives a better payoff than advertising. But when the competitor doesn't advertise, advertising is better. That way, there's no strict dominance.\n\nSo, let's tweak the advertising cost. Suppose advertising costs more, say 20M instead of 10M. Then, if both advertise, each gets 25M -20M =5M. If one advertises and the other doesn't, the advertiser gets 50M -20M=30M, and the other gets 0. If neither advertises, both get 25M.\n\nNow, check for strict dominance. If the competitor doesn't advertise, my choices: Advertise gives 30M, Not gives 25M. So advertise is better. If the competitor advertises, my choices: Advertise gives 5M, Not gives 0. So advertise is still better. Hmm, still strict dominance.\n\nAlternatively, maybe adjust the split when both advertise. Suppose if both advertise, they split 50M but advertising costs 10M. So each gets 25M -10M =15M. If neither, 25M each. If one advertises, that firm gets 50M -10M=40M, other 0. Wait, same as original. Still dominant.\n\nAnother approach: Make the payoff when both advertise higher than when only one advertises. Wait, that's not possible because if both advertise, they split the market. Maybe if advertising when the other doesn't is less profitable. For example, if advertising costs 30M. Then, if I advertise alone, 50M -30M=20M. If competitor advertises and I don't, I get 0. If both advertise, 25M -30M= -5M. If neither, 25M. Now, check: If competitor doesn't advertise, my options: Advertise (20M) vs Not (25M). So Not is better. If competitor advertises, my options: Advertise (-5M) vs Not (0). So Not is better. Now, Not advertising strictly dominates. So that's the opposite. But the user wants to remove strict dominance. So maybe adjust so that neither action is strictly better in all cases.\n\nLet's try a different structure. Suppose when both advertise, they split 50M, but advertising costs 15M. So each gets 25M -15M=10M. If neither, 25M each. If one advertises, they get 50M -15M=35M, other 0. Now, check:\n\nIf competitor doesn't advertise: Advertise (35) vs Not (25). Advertise better.\n\nIf competitor does advertise: Advertise (10) vs Not (0). Advertise better. Still strict dominance.\n\nHmm. Need a scenario where sometimes advertise is better, sometimes not. Let's adjust the payoff when both advertise. Suppose when both advertise, the total sales are higher? Wait, original problem says regardless of advertising, total sales are 50M. So that can't change. So maybe adjust the cost. Let's say advertising costs 20M. Then:\n\nIf both advertise: 25M -20M=5M each.\n\nIf neither: 25M each.\n\nIf I advertise and competitor doesn't: 50M -20M=30M for me, 0 for them.\n\nIf competitor advertises and I don't: 0 for me, 30M for them.\n\nNow, check my choices:\n\nIf competitor doesn't advertise: Advertise (30) vs Not (25). Advertise better.\n\nIf competitor advertises: Advertise (5) vs Not (0). Advertise better. Still strict dominance.\n\nAlternatively, if advertising cost is 30M:\n\nIf I advertise alone: 50M -30M=20M.\n\nIf both advertise: 25M -30M= -5M.\n\nIf competitor advertises and I don't: 0.\n\nIf neither:25M.\n\nNow, if competitor doesn't advertise: Advertise (20) vs Not (25). Not better.\n\nIf competitor advertises: Advertise (-5) vs Not (0). Not better.\n\nSo now, Not advertising strictly dominates. But the original problem had advertising as dominant. So changing the cost to 30M flips the dominance. But the user wants to eliminate strict dominance, not reverse it.\n\nSo need a setup where neither action is strictly dominant. For example, when the competitor chooses to advertise, my best response is to not advertise, and when they don't, my best response is to advertise. That way, there's no strict dominance.\n\nHow to do that? Let's set the payoffs such that:\n\nIf competitor advertises:\n\n- If I advertise: get X.\n\n- If I don't: get Y. Need Y > X.\n\nIf competitor doesn't advertise:\n\n- If I advertise: get A.\n\n- If I don't: get B. Need A > B.\n\nSo, in this case, the best response depends on the opponent's action. So no strict dominance.\n\nSo let's construct such a matrix.\n\nSuppose:\n\nIf both advertise: Each gets 25M -10M =15M.\n\nIf neither: 25M each.\n\nIf I advertise and competitor doesn't: I get 50M -10M=40M, they get 0.\n\nIf competitor advertises and I don't: I get 0, they get 40M.\n\nBut in this case, advertising is still dominant for me. Because if competitor doesn't advertise, I get 40 vs 25. If they do advertise, I get 15 vs 0. So still better to advertise.\n\nSo to change that, need a different structure. Maybe when competitor advertises, not advertising gives me a higher payoff than advertising.\n\nSuppose when both advertise, the cost is higher. Let's say advertising costs 20M.\n\nSo:\n\nBoth advertise: 25M -20M=5M each.\n\nNeither:25M each.\n\nI advertise, they don't: 50M -20M=30M for me, 0 for them.\n\nThey advertise, I don't: 0 for me, 30M for them.\n\nNow, check my payoffs:\n\nIf competitor doesn't advertise: Advertise (30) vs Not (25). Advertise better.\n\nIf competitor advertises: Advertise (5) vs Not (0). Advertise better. Still dominant.\n\nHmm. Not working. Let's try a different approach. Maybe when both advertise, the split isn't equal. Suppose if both advertise, I get a larger share. But the problem states that if both advertise, the split is even. So maybe adjust the sales when both advertise. Wait, original problem says that if both advertise, split is even. So can't change that. Unless we modify the problem to allow different splits when both advertise. But the user wants to modify the example, so perhaps that's allowed.\n\nAlternatively, introduce a scenario where advertising is more effective for one firm. But the problem states that the firms are symmetric. So maybe asymmetric costs.\n\nWait, the user's example is symmetric. But maybe in the modified version, the costs or payoffs are asymmetric. However, the user's original problem is symmetric. To remove strict dominance, perhaps introduce asymmetry. But the problem says \"my firm and a competitor firm\", so they can have different payoffs.\n\nWait, but the original problem is symmetric. To remove strict dominance, perhaps make the payoffs such that for one firm, advertising is not dominant, but for the other it is. But the user wants to change the example so that it's not an instance of strict dominance. So the entire game should not have any strictly dominant strategies.\n\nSo, need to adjust the payoffs so that neither player has a strictly dominant strategy.\n\nIn a 2x2 matrix, for each player, neither of their actions strictly dominates the other. So for each player, for each action, there exists at least one opponent's action where the other action is better.\n\nLet's construct such a matrix.\n\nPlayer 1 (me) has two actions: Advertise (A) or Not (N).\n\nPlayer 2 (competitor) has same actions.\n\nWe need to set payoffs such that for Player 1:\n\n- If Player 2 chooses A, then N is better for Player 1.\n\n- If",
