    "inferences": "To make the example not an instance of Strict Dominance, we need to ensure that there is no single strategy that is always better than the other, regardless of the opponent's strategy. This means that we need to introduce a scenario where the payoffs for both options are dependent on the opponent's choice.\n\nLet's modify the example by introducing a third player, a friend, who also needs to decide where to have dinner. The friend has the same options as the original player, and the wait time at the Central Square cafe depends on the number of people choosing to eat there. If both the original player and the friend choose the Central Square cafe, the wait time will be 10 minutes. If only one of them chooses the Central Square cafe, the wait time will be 5 minutes. If neither of them chooses the Central Square cafe, the wait time will be 0 minutes.\n\nThe payoff matrix for this modified game is as follows:\n\n[[ (0,0), (5,5) ],\n [ (5,5), (10,10) ]]\n\nIn this matrix, the rows represent the original player's choices (Harvard Square cafe or Central Square cafe), and the columns represent the friend's choices (Harvard Square cafe or Central Square cafe). The payoffs in each cell represent the wait time for the original player (first number) and the friend (second number) respectively.\n\nIn this modified game, there is no strict dominance because the optimal choice for the original player depends on the friend's choice. If the friend chooses the Harvard Square cafe, the original player should also choose the Harvard Square cafe to avoid any wait time. If the friend chooses the Central Square cafe, the original player should also choose the Central Square cafe to minimize the wait time to 5 minutes. Therefore, there is no single strategy that is always better than the other, and the game is not an instance of Strict Dominance.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n\n[[ (0,0), (5,5) ],\n [ (5,5), (10,10) ]]",
