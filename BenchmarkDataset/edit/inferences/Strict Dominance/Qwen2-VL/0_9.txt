    "inferences": "The game theory concept of Strict Dominance means that one strategy is always better than another, regardless of what the other player does. In this case, advertising is the strictly dominant strategy for both firms, as it always results in higher sales and profits than not advertising. The payoff matrix for this game would be:\n[[ (0,0), (25,50) ],\n [ (50,25), (25,25) ]]\nIn this matrix, the first number in each cell represents the payoff for the row player (my firm), and the second number represents the payoff for the column player (the competitor firm). The top left cell represents the scenario where neither firm advertises, the top right cell represents the scenario where my firm advertises and the competitor does not, the bottom left cell represents the scenario where the competitor advertises and my firm does not, and the bottom right cell represents the scenario where both firms advertise. As you can see, advertising is the strictly dominant strategy for both firms, as it always results in higher payoffs than not advertising.",
