Let's consider the following modified payoffs:\n\n- If neither firm advertises, both firms get $25 million in sales.\n- If both firms advertise, both firms get $20 million in sales (since the total market is $50 million, and each firm spends $10 million on advertising).\n- If one firm advertises and the other does not, the firm that advertises gets $40 million in sales, and the other firm gets $10 million in sales.\n\nNow, let's create the 2x2 payoff matrix for this modified game:\n\n[[ (25, 25), (10, 40) ],\n [ (40, 10), (20, 20) ]]\n\nIn this matrix, neither strategy (advertising or not advertising) strictly dominates the other for both firms. For example, if Firm 1 chooses to advertise, Firm 2's best response is not to advertise (40 > 20). However, if Firm 1 chooses not to advertise, Firm 2's best response is to advertise (40 > 25). Similarly, for Firm 1, if Firm 2 chooses to advertise, Firm 1's best response is not to advertise (10 > 20). But if Firm 2 chooses not to advertise, Firm 1's best response is to advertise (40 > 25). Thus, neither strategy strictly dominates the other for both firms.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (25, 25), (10, 40) ],\n [ (40, 10), (20, 20) ]]",
