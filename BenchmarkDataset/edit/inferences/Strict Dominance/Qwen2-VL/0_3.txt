    "inferences": "To make this an instance of Strict Dominance, we can represent the situation as a game between you and your brother, where the strategies are the buildings you choose to go to (45 or 52) and the payoffs are based on whether you meet up or not. Since you don't care which building you end up at, we can assign the same payoff to meeting up in either building. However, your brother hates building 52 and will never go there unless he has to, so we can assign a lower payoff to meeting up in building 52 than in building 45.\nThe resulting payoff matrix is:\n[[ (1,1), (1,0) ],\n [ (0,1), (0,0) ]]\nIn this matrix, the first row represents you going to building 45 and the second row represents you going to building 52. The first column represents your brother going to building 45 and the second column represents your brother going to building 52. The payoffs are given in the format (payoff for you, payoff for your brother).\nIn this game, going to building 45 is a strictly dominant strategy for both you and your brother, since it always results in a higher payoff than going to building 52. Therefore, the Nash equilibrium of this game is for both of you to go to building 45, resulting in a payoff of (1,1).\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (1,1), (1,0) ],\n [ (0,1), (0,0) ]]",
