Let's say the Harvard Square cafe always has a 0-minute wait, while the Central Square cafe has a wait time that varies between 5 and 10 minutes. \n\nSince we are trying to minimize wait time, going to the Harvard Square cafe will always result in a better outcome (0 minutes) than going to the Central Square cafe (5-10 minutes), regardless of what other people choose. \n\nThis can be represented as a game between two players: Player 1 (you) and Player 2 (other people). The payoffs will be the negative of the wait times, since we want to maximize the payoff (i.e., minimize the wait time).\n\nHere is the payoff matrix:\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (0,0), (0,0) ],\n [ (-5,-5), (-10,-10) ]]",
