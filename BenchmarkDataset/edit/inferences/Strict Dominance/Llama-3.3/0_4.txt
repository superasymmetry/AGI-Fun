    "inferences": "To change the given example so that it's not an instance of the Strict Dominance concept in game theory, we need to ensure that no single strategy is better than all other strategies regardless of what the other player chooses. \n\nIn the given example, playing rock seems to be a dominant strategy for Player 1 because it yields the highest payoff against any of Eric's possible moves. To eliminate strict dominance, we need to adjust the payoffs so that no strategy is always better than the others.\n\nLet's modify the payoffs to achieve this. We'll keep the original payoffs for playing scissors, as they are already non-dominant. For rock and paper, we'll adjust the payoffs so that each has situations where it's better and situations where it's worse than the other options.\n\nIf one person plays scissors and the other plays rock, then rock wins 10 points and scissors wins 0 points. \nIf one person plays scissors and the other plays paper, then paper wins 1 point and scissors wins 0 points. \nIf both players play scissors, then both players win 0 points. \nIf one person plays rock and the other plays paper, the person playing rock wins 2 points, and the person playing paper wins 3 points. \nIf we both play rock, we both win 4 points. \nIf we both play paper, we both win 1 point.\n\nNow, let's create a payoff matrix based on these rules. We'll consider the strategies for Player 1 (me) as the rows and the strategies for Player 2 (Eric) as the columns. The payoffs will be (Player 1, Player 2).\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (10,0), (2,3) ],\n [ (0,1), (1,1) ]]",
