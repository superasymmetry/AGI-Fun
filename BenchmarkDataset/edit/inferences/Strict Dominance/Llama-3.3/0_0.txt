    "inferences": "To change the given example so that it is not an instance of the Strict Dominance concept in game theory, we need to modify the scenario such that neither option strictly dominates the other. In the original example, going to the Harvard Square cafe strictly dominates going to the Central Square cafe because there's never a wait in Harvard Square, making it the better choice regardless of the wait time in Central Square.\n\nLet's modify the scenario: Suppose the wait time in both locations can vary, but in a way that makes one location better under certain conditions and the other location better under different conditions. For instance, let's say the wait at Harvard Square can be either 0 minutes or 15 minutes, depending on an event (like a festival) that might be happening, and the wait at Central Square can be either 5 minutes or 10 minutes, depending on the same event. However, to truly avoid strict dominance, we need to ensure that the outcomes are intertwined in such a way that choosing one location over the other does not always yield a better result regardless of the other's choice.\n\nHowever, the original prompt asks for a payoff matrix that represents a game where strict dominance is avoided. Let's create a payoff matrix for a different scenario that fits the bill, considering two players (Player 1 and Player 2) and their strategies (A for Player 1 and B for Player 2), with payoffs that do not allow for strict dominance:\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (3,3), (0,5) ],\n [ (5,0), (2,2) ]]",
