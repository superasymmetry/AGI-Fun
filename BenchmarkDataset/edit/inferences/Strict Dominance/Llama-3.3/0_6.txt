    "inferences": "To change the given example so that it's not an instance of the Strict Dominance game theory concept, we need to ensure that neither \"A\" nor \"B\" is a strictly dominant strategy for either player. A strategy is strictly dominant if it yields a higher payoff than any other strategy for every possible action of the other player.\n\nGiven the original payoff matrix:\n- (A, A) leads to payoffs (4, 7)\n- (A, B) leads to payoffs (0, 3)\n- (B, A) leads to payoffs (2, 2)\n- (B, B) leads to payoffs (-1, 1)\n\nWe observe that \"A\" is not strictly dominant for the player because against \"B\", choosing \"B\" yields a higher payoff (-1) than choosing \"A\" (0). However, to ensure neither strategy is strictly dominant, we should adjust the payoffs so that each strategy has scenarios where it outperforms the other, regardless of the opponent's move.\n\nLet's adjust the payoffs to make the game not an instance of Strict Dominance:\n- If the player chooses \"A\" when the computer chooses \"A\", the payoff could be (3, 7).\n- If the player chooses \"A\" when the computer chooses \"B\", the payoff could be (2, 3), making \"A\" against \"B\" more favorable than before.\n- If the player chooses \"B\" when the computer chooses \"A\", the payoff could remain (2, 2), as it already is not strictly dominant.\n- If the player chooses \"B\" when the computer chooses \"B\", the payoff could be adjusted to (1, 1), making \"B\" against \"B\" more favorable and ensuring \"B\" is sometimes better than \"A\".\n\nThis adjustment ensures that neither \"A\" nor \"B\" is strictly dominant because the best choice depends on what the computer chooses.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (3, 7), (2, 3) ],\n [ (2, 2), (1, 1) ]]",
