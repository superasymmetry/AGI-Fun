    "inferences": "To make this example not an instance of the Strict Dominance concept, we need to adjust the payoffs so that one strategy does not always yield a better payoff than the other, regardless of the opponent's action. \n\nIn the original scenario, if one firm advertises and the other does not, the advertising firm gets $50 million in sales, but since advertising costs $10 million, the net gain is $40 million. If both firms advertise, they split the $50 million, but after paying $10 million for advertising, each gets $20 million. If neither firm advertises, they split the $50 million evenly, resulting in $25 million each.\n\nLet's modify the scenario so that the cost of advertising is $20 million, and the total market size remains $50 million. \n\n- If one firm advertises and the other does not, the advertising firm gets $50 million in sales but pays $20 million for advertising, resulting in a net gain of $30 million. The non-advertising firm gets $0.\n- If both firms advertise, they split the $50 million, but after paying $20 million each for advertising, each firm gets $5 million.\n- If neither firm advertises, they split the $50 million evenly, resulting in $25 million each.\n\nThis adjustment changes the payoffs so that advertising does not strictly dominate not advertising, as the outcome depends on what the other firm chooses.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (25,25), (30,0) ],\n [ (0,30), (5,5) ]]",
