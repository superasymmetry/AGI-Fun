    "inferences": "To change the given example so it's not an instance of the Strict Dominance concept in game theory, we need to ensure that there's no strategy that is better than another regardless of what the other player chooses. In the original scenario, going to building 52 is strictly dominant for you because you prefer being alone in building 52 over being with your brother in building 45, and you also prefer seeing your brother in building 52 (if he were to go there) over not seeing him there.\n\nLet's modify the preferences so that there's no strict dominance. Suppose your preference is to see your brother, regardless of the building, but you still have a slight preference for building 52 over building 45 when your brother's choice is the same. However, if your brother chooses building 45 and you choose building 52, your payoff is lower than if you both choose building 45. This way, there's no strict dominance because the best choice for you depends on what your brother chooses.\n\nHere's a payoff matrix representing this situation:\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (3,1), (0,0) ],\n [ (2,2), (4,3) ]]",
