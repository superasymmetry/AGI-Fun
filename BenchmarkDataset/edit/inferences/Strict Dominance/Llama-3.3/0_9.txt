    "inferences": "To create an instance of the game theory concept of Strict Dominance, we need to modify the given example so that one strategy is better for a player regardless of what the other player chooses. \n\nIn the original example, if one firm advertises but the other firm does not, then the company that advertises gets all $50 million in sales, and the other company gets no sales. However, advertising costs $25 million. So, the payoff for advertising when the other firm does not is $50 million - $25 million = $25 million, and the payoff for not advertising when the other firm does advertise is $0. If both firms advertise, they each get $25 million in sales, but they each spend $25 million on advertising, resulting in a payoff of $0 for each firm. If neither firm advertises, they split the $50 million evenly, resulting in a payoff of $25 million for each firm.\n\nTo make this an instance of Strict Dominance, let's modify the cost of advertising. Suppose advertising now costs $5 million instead of $25 million. \n\nIf one firm advertises but the other firm does not, the payoff for the advertising firm would be $50 million - $5 million = $45 million, and $0 for the non-advertising firm. \nIf both firms advertise, each firm gets $25 million in sales but spends $5 million on advertising, resulting in a payoff of $20 million for each firm. \nIf neither firm advertises, the payoff remains $25 million for each firm.\n\nNow, let's examine the payoffs:\n\n- If the competitor firm advertises, my firm gets $0 if I don't advertise and $20 million if I do advertise.\n- If the competitor firm does not advertise, my firm gets $25 million if I don't advertise and $45 million if I do advertise.\n\nIn this scenario, advertising strictly dominates not advertising for my firm, as I get a higher payoff from advertising regardless of what the competitor firm chooses.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (45,20), (25,20) ],\n [ (0,45), (20,20) ]]",
