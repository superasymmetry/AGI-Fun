We always meet up in either building 45 or building 52 at MIT. I know that if I go to building 45, I will definitely find him there because he prefers that building. On the other hand, if I go to building 52, there's a chance he might not be there because he hates it, but if he is there, it would be a pleasant surprise for both of us and we would have a better time together. As for my brother, he doesn't care where we meet, but he does prefer meeting me in building 45.\n\nNow, let's assign payoffs to each possible outcome. We'll use the following payoffs:\n- If I meet my brother in building 45, I get a payoff of 10 and he gets a payoff of 5.\n- If I meet my brother in building 52, I get a payoff of 15 and he gets a payoff of 5.\n- If I go to building 45 and my brother goes to building 52, I get a payoff of 0 and he gets a payoff of 0.\n- If I go to building 52 and my brother goes to building 45, I get a payoff of 0 and he gets a payoff of 0.\n\nHere is the payoff matrix for this game:\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (10,5), (0,0) ],\n [ (0,0), (15,5) ]]",
