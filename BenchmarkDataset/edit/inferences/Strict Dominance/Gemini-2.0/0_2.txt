    "inferences": "To make this scenario *not* an example of strict dominance, we need to create a situation where neither strategy (going to building 45 or building 52) is *always* better than the other, regardless of what your brother does.\n\nHere's a modified scenario:\n\n**I'm trying to meet up with my brother in Cambridge, but his phone just died and I cannot reach him. We always meet up in either building 45 or building 52 at MIT, and I know he'll go to one of those buildings right now.**\n\n**I know that he hates building 52 and will never go there unless I make him go there.  As for me, *if I think he's likely to go to building 45, I really want to see him.*  However, *if I think he might go to building 52, I absolutely want to avoid him, because I know he'll be in a terrible mood*. Building 52 is usually my favorite building, but today, *I'd prefer to be alone in building 45 than to see my brother in building 52.* Which building should I go to?**\n\n**Explanation of the Change:**\n\n*   **Context-Dependent Preferences:**  Crucially, your preference for seeing or avoiding your brother *depends on which building he's in.* You *want* to see him in 45, but you *don't* want to see him in 52.  This eliminates the unconditional preference for seeing him described in the original scenario.\n*   **No Strict Dominance:** Now, there's no strictly dominant strategy:\n    *   If you believe your brother is likely at building 45, then going to building 45 is a good choice.\n    *   If you believe your brother might be at building 52, then going to building 45 could be bad, and you might want to go to building 52.\n\n**Why the Original Scenario Had Strict Dominance:**\n\nIn the original, for any fixed building you go to, you wanted to see your brother there. This meant seeing your brother was *always* preferable, regardless of which building it was. You also liked building 52 more than building 45. This means that the best possible scenario was that you went to building 52 and your brother was there, so going to building 52 was the strictly dominant choice.\n\nIn the modified scenario, my preference to avoid my brother when he goes to building 52 eliminates that strict dominance.\n",
