    "inferences": "Here's how to modify the payoff matrix so that neither action (A or B) strictly dominates the other for you:\n\n```\nActions (A, A) leads to payoffs (4, 7)\nActions (A, B) leads to payoffs (0, 3)\nActions (B, A) leads to payoffs (5, 2)\nActions (B, B) leads to payoffs (-1, 1)\n```\n\n**Explanation of Changes and Why it Eliminates Strict Dominance**\n\n*   **Original Problem:** In the original matrix, action A strictly dominated action B. Regardless of what the computer did (A or B), you always got a higher payoff by choosing A. (4>2 if the computer chooses A, and 0>-1 if the computer chooses B).\n*   **Revised Problem:**  By changing the (B,A) payoff to (5,2), we've created a scenario where your best choice depends on what the computer does:\n\n    *   If the computer chooses A, you should choose B (payoff of 5 > payoff of 4 from choosing A).\n    *   If the computer chooses B, you should choose A (payoff of 0 > payoff of -1 from choosing B).\n\nSince your optimal action now *depends* on the computer's action, neither strategy strictly dominates the other.\n",
