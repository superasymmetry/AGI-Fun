    "inferences": "Okay, here's how we can modify the Rock-Paper-Scissors game to create a strict dominance situation.  We need to adjust the payoffs so that one strategy is *always* better than another, no matter what Eric chooses.\n\nHere's the modified scenario:\n\n**Scenario: Strict Dominance in Rock-Paper-Scissors**\n\nI'm playing a modified rock-paper-scissors game with my friend Eric. The scoring is as follows:\n\n*   **Rock vs. Scissors:** Rock wins 10 points, Scissors wins -10 points.\n*   **Scissors vs. Paper:** Scissors wins 5 points, Paper wins -5 points.\n*   **Rock vs. Paper:** Paper wins 1 point, Rock wins 0 points.\n*   **Rock vs. Rock:** Both win 0 points.\n*   **Paper vs. Paper:** Both win 0 points.\n*   **Scissors vs. Scissors:** Both win 0 points.\n\n**Payoff Matrix for You (Rows are your choices, Columns are Eric's choices):**\n\n|          | Eric Plays Rock | Eric Plays Paper | Eric Plays Scissors |\n|----------|-----------------|------------------|---------------------|\n| You Play Rock    | 0              | 0                | 10                  |\n| You Play Paper   | 1              | 0                | -5                  |\n| You Play Scissors| -10             | 5                | 0                   |\n\n**Analysis of Strict Dominance:**\n\nIn this game, the Rock strategy *strictly dominates* the Paper strategy. Let's break down why:\n\n*   **If Eric plays Rock:** Rock gives you 0 points and Paper gives you 1 point. **Rock does Worse.**\n*   **If Eric plays Paper:** Rock gives you 0 points and Paper gives you 0 point. **Rock does just as Well.**\n*   **If Eric plays Scissors:** Rock gives you 10 points and Paper gives you -5 points. **Rock does Better.**\n\nTherefore, Rock is always at least as good as, and in some cases better than, Paper, no matter what Eric chooses.\n\n*   **If Eric plays Rock:** Scissors gives you -10 points and Rock gives you 0 points. **Rock does Better.**\n*   **If Eric plays Paper:** Scissors gives you 5 points and Rock gives you 0 points. **Scissors does Worse.**\n*   **If Eric plays Scissors:** Scissors gives you 0 points and Rock gives you 10 points. **Rock does Better.**\n\nTherefore, Rock is always at least as good as, and in some cases better than, Scissors, no matter what Eric chooses.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe optimal strategy for you is to **always play Rock**. Because it strictly dominates the other two options. You can eliminate the other strategies as irrational. A rational player would play Rock.\n\n**Key Points about Strict Dominance:**\n\n*   A strategy *strictly dominates* another strategy if it yields a *higher* payoff for the player, *regardless* of what the opponent(s) choose.\n*   A rational player will always choose a strategy that strictly dominates all other strategies. They would never choose a dominated strategy.\n*   In games with strict dominance, the solution is often quite simple \u2013 identify the strictly dominant strategy and play it.\n",
