    "inferences": "Okay, here's a modified scenario that removes the strict dominance.  I've done this by introducing a possible benefit to going to the Central Square location that can outweigh the potential wait:\n\n**Modified Scenario:**\n\nI'm trying to decide whether to have dinner at the Life Alive cafe in Harvard Square, or the Life Alive cafe in Central Square. Both have the same menu, but there's a slight difference:\n\n*   **Life Alive Harvard Square:** I know from experience that there's *usually* no wait. However, they have been experiencing issues lately with the quality of some of their produce and the food has been sub-par some days.\n*   **Life Alive Central Square:** The wait in the Central Square cafe varies between 5 and 10 minutes, depending on where other people choose to eat. *However, their food quality is more consistent. Also, I have a friend who works there, and sometimes he can get me a free drink or a discount.*\n\n**Why This is Not Strict Dominance:**\n\n*   **No Guaranteed Better Option:** In the original scenario, Harvard Square was strictly dominant because it *always* provided a better outcome (no wait) regardless of what others did.\n\n*   **Possible Benefits of Central Square:** Now, the decision is more nuanced. Central Square could be *better* if:\n    *   The wait is short.\n    *   The food quality in Harvard Square is bad.\n    *   I get a free drink or discount from my friend.\n\n    While Harvard Square is *often* better, it's not *always* better. I now need to consider the possibility of the above occuring and make a decision based on weighing the potential outcomes.\n\nThis makes the decision more strategic and dependent on my own preferences (e.g., how much I value consistent food quality vs. saving time) and my beliefs about the likelihood of getting a discount. There is no longer one strategy that's *always* better than the other.",
