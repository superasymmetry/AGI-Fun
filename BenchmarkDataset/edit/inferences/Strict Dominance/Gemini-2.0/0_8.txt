If the competitor advertises, advertising yields 15 million (50-10) vs not advertising yields 0 million. If the competitor doesn't advertise, advertising yields 40 million (50-10) vs not advertising yields 25 million.\n\nHere's how we can change the payoffs to eliminate strict dominance:\n\n**Modified Scenario:**\n\nMy firm and a competitor firm are deciding whether or not we want to advertise for the cereal we\u2019re selling.
