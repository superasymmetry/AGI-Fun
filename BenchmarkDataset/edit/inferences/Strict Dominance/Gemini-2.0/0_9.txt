    "inferences": "Here's the modified example to create a game with strict dominance, along with explanations:\n\n**Modified Example**\n\nMy firm and a competitor firm are deciding whether or not we want to advertise for the cereal we\u2019re selling. Consumers will purchase a total of $50 million dollars of cereal in total (summed up across my firm and the competitor firm).\n\n*   **If neither firm advertises**, this \\$50 million is split evenly, and both firms have \\$25 million in sales. Advertising costs \\$15 million.\n*   **If both firms advertise**, the \\$50 million is split evenly, and both firms have \\$25 million in sales. Advertising costs \\$15 million.\n*   **If my firm advertises, and the competitor doesn't**, I will receive \\$40 million in sales, and the competitor receives \\$10 million in sales.\n*   **If the competitor advertises, and I don't**, the competitor will receive \\$40 million in sales, and I will receive \\$10 million in sales.\n*   **Advertising costs \\$15 million.**\n\nShould my firm advertise or not?\n\n**Payoff Matrix**\n\nTo better illustrate, let's create a payoff matrix showing the profit for My Firm given the choices of both firms:\n\n| My Firm  | Competitor Advertises | Competitor Doesn't Advertise |\n| -------- | --------------------- | --------------------------- |\n| Advertise | \\$10M (\\$25M - \\$15M)    | \\$25M (\\$40M - \\$15M)        |\n| Don't Advertise | -\\$5M (\\$10M - \\$15M)        | \\$25M (\\$25M - \\$0)           |\n\n**Explanation of Strict Dominance**\n\n*   **Strict Dominance Defined:** A strategy is strictly dominant if, regardless of what the other player(s) do, that strategy always yields a strictly higher payoff for a player than any other strategy available to that player.\n\n*   **Applying it to the Game:** In this modified example, advertising is a strictly dominant strategy for both firms.  Let's see why from My Firm's perspective:\n\n    *   **If the Competitor Advertises:** My Firm's profit is \\$10M if it advertises, and -\\$5M if it does not. Advertising is better.\n    *   **If the Competitor Does Not Advertise:** My Firm's profit is \\$25M if it advertises, and \\$25M if it does not. Advertising is better.\n\n    Because advertising yields a strictly higher payoff regardless of what the competitor does, advertising is a strictly dominant strategy for My Firm. The same logic applies to the competitor.\n\n**Why the Original Example Didn't Have Strict Dominance**\n\nIn the original scenario, the advertising cost was too high (\\$25 million).  This meant that if both firms advertised, they would essentially break even.  If the competitor didn't advertise, My Firm did better by advertising. But if the competitor did advertise, My Firm did worse by advertising.\n\nThis meant there was no strategy that always gave My Firm a better payoff regardless of what the competitor did.\n\n**Key Changes Made**\n\n*   **Adjusted Advertising Cost:** The key change was reducing the advertising cost (\\$15 million). This makes advertising a more appealing option.\n*   **Adjusted Sales When One Firm Advertises:** Adjusted sales when only one firm advertises, so that neither firm would be guaranteed \\$50 million in sales, or \\$0 in sales.\n",
