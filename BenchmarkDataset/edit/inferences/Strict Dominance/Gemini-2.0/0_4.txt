    "inferences": "To make the game **not** have a strictly dominant strategy, we need to ensure that no single choice (Rock, Paper, or Scissors) *always* yields a better payoff than the other choices, regardless of what Eric plays. The current setup likely has a dominant strategy. Let's modify the payoffs to avoid that.\n\nHere's a modified payoff structure to eliminate strict dominance:\n\n**Modified Rock-Paper-Scissors Rules:**\n\n*   **Scissors vs. Rock:** Rock wins 1 point, Scissors wins 0 points.\n*   **Scissors vs. Paper:** Scissors wins 2 points, Paper wins 1 point.\n*   **Scissors vs. Scissors:** Both win 0 points.\n*   **Rock vs. Paper:** Paper wins 3 points, Rock wins 2 points.\n*   **Rock vs. Rock:** Both win 1 point.\n*   **Paper vs. Paper:** Both win 2 points.\n\n**Explanation of Changes:**\n\nThe core idea is to create a cycle where each option can be a good choice depending on what the opponent does.\n\n*   **No Clear Winner:** Now, there's no strategy that *always* gives you a higher payoff than any other.\n*   **Contingent Best Responses:** The optimal choice now *depends* on what you think Eric will play. If you believe Eric will play Rock a lot, playing Paper is a good strategy. If you think Eric will play Paper a lot, playing Scissors is a good strategy. If you think Eric will play Scissors a lot, playing Rock is a good strategy.\n*   **No Strict Dominance:** A strictly dominant strategy means one strategy is *always* better, no matter what the other player does. In this new structure, no strategy is strictly dominant.\n\n**Why this works:**\n\nThis game will likely require mixed strategies (randomizing your choices) to achieve a Nash equilibrium. There's no single \"best\" move you can always make. The best move depends on the perceived probability of what your opponent will play.\n\n",
