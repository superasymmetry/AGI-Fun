In this case, we want to show that Building 45 is strictly dominant for both players.\n\nFor Player 1 (me):\n- Going to Building 45 should give a higher payoff than Building 52, no matter what my brother does\n- Since I just want to find my brother, I'll get positive utility when we meet\n\nFor Player 2 (brother):\n- Since he hates Building 52, he should get much lower utility there\n- Building 45 should give him higher payoff regardless of what I do\n\nLet's create payoffs where:\n- When we meet in Building 45, both get good payoffs (4,4)\n- When we meet in Building 52, lower payoffs due to brother's preference (2,1)\n- When we miss each other, very low payoffs (1,1) for Building 45\n- When we miss each other at Building 52, even worse (0,0)\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (4,4), (1,1) ],\n [ (2,1), (0,0) ]]",
