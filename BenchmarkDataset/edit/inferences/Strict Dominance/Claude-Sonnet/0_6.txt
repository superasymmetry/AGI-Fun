We can do this by making strategy B better in at least one case.\n\nLet's modify the payoffs so that when the computer plays B, strategy B gives a higher payoff than strategy A for Player 1. We'll keep the other values similar but adjust them to remove the dominance.\n\nI'll make these changes:\n- Keep (A,A) at (4,7)\n- Keep (A,B) at (0,3)\n- Keep (B,A) at (2,2)\n- Change (B,B) from (-1,1) to (3,1)\n\nNow, strategy A is better when computer plays A (4>2), but strategy B is better when computer plays B (3>0), thus removing strict dominance.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[(4,7), (0,3)],\n [(2,2), (3,1)]]",
