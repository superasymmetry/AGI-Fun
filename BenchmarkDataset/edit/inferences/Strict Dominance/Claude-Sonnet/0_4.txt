    "inferences": "Let me help modify this game to remove strict dominance.\n\nIn the original scenario, scissors is strictly dominated because it always gives a worse payoff compared to other strategies (it either gives 0 or at best ties with 0).\n\nTo remove strict dominance, we need to make scissors a potentially viable strategy by improving some of its payoffs. Let's modify the payoffs so that no strategy is always better than another strategy.\n\nLet's change the rules:\n1. Rock vs Scissors: Keep at (10,0)\n2. Scissors vs Paper: Change to (5,1) - making scissors much stronger against paper\n3. Scissors vs Scissors: Change to (3,3) - making mutual scissors play worthwhile\n4. Rock vs Paper: Keep at (3,2)\n5. Rock vs Rock: Keep at (4,4)\n6. Paper vs Paper: Keep at (1,1)\n\nNow, representing this as a 2x2 matrix (we'll use Rock and Scissors as the strategies to keep it 2x2):\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[(4,4), (10,0)],\n [(0,10), (3,3)]]",
