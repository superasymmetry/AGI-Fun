Keep the $50M total market size\n2. Keep the $10M advertising cost\n3. Change the market split when one advertises and other doesn't to 35M-15M (instead of 50M-0M)\n4. Keep the equal split (25M-25M) when both take same action\n\nThis creates a scenario where:\n- If both advertise: Each gets $25M - $10M = $15M\n- If neither advertises: Each gets $25M\n- If one advertises and other doesn't: Advertiser gets $35M - $10M = $25M, Non-advertiser gets $15M\n\nNow there's no strict dominance because:\n- If opponent advertises: Not advertising (15) = Advertising (15)\n- If opponent doesn't advertise: Advertising (25) = Not advertising (25)\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (25,25), (15,25) ],\n [ (25,15), (15,15) ]]",
