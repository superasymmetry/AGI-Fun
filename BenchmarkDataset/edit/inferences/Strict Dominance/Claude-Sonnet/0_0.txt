To remove strict dominance, we need to create a situation where neither option is always better than the other.\n\nLet's modify the scenario by adding some trade-offs:\n- Harvard Square location: Has reliable service but is more expensive\n- Central Square location: Has varying wait times but is cheaper\n\nThis could be represented in a payoff matrix where:\n- Player 1 chooses between Harvard or Central\n- Player 2's \"choices\" represent the two possible states of how busy Central Square is\n- The numbers represent utility (combining both time and money factors)\n\nI'll create a matrix where sometimes Harvard Square is better (when Central is busy) and sometimes Central Square is better (when it's not busy).\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[(3,3), (3,2)],\n [(4,2), (1,4)]]",
