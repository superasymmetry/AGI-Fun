Advertising still costs $25 million\n2. If neither firm advertises, they split $50 million in sales (each gets $25 million)\n3. If both firms advertise, instead of splitting evenly, the market expands to $100 million total, and they split that (each gets $50 million, but minus $25 million advertising cost)\n4. If one firm advertises and the other doesn't, the advertising firm gets $80 million (minus $25 million cost), and the non-advertising firm gets $20 million\n\nThis creates a situation where advertising strictly dominates not advertising for each player.\n\nLet's calculate the payoffs:\n- Neither advertises: (25, 25)\n- Both advertise: (25, 25) [Each gets 50 - 25 advertising cost]\n- Only Player 1 advertises: (55, 20) [Player 1 gets 80 - 25 advertising cost]\n- Only Player 2 advertises: (20, 55) [Player 2 gets 80 - 25 advertising cost]\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (25,25), (20,55) ],\n [ (55,20), (25,25) ]]",
