In this case, we'll make the Harvard Square location strictly dominate the Central Square location.\n\nLet's model this with:\n- Player 1 is me deciding between Harvard Square (HS) and Central Square (CS)\n- Player 2 represents \"other people\" choosing between HS and CS\n\nFor Harvard Square:\n- When others go to HS: Payoff = 10 (no wait, as stated)\n- When others go to CS: Payoff = 10 (no wait, as stated)\n\nFor Central Square:\n- When others go to HS: Payoff = 8 (small wait)\n- When others go to CS: Payoff = 5 (longer wait due to crowding)\n\nWe'll set Player 2's payoffs to be symmetric for simplicity.\n\nThis creates strict dominance because Harvard Square gives better payoffs (10 > 8 and 10 > 5) regardless of what other people do.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[(10,10), (10,8)],\n [(8,10), (5,5)]]",
