She told me we'd be 12 girls in total, most are her friends I've met before but we're not close but I was fine with it since I was looking forward to making new friends.\n\nDays later we agreed on an amount to contribute per person, we also agreed that after everyone contributes we will make a budget together keeping in mind people's allergies or diet restrictions.\n\nThen on Monday H texted me and sent a document of the budget? I was shocked but still opened it and I found a lot of the food there were things I cannot eat due to allergies and food restrictions. I asked her about it and she answered that the majority agreed with those things and that I should get over it and that i can just eat the other things there.\n\nI thought about it and decided I wouldn't go, and here's were I was called the asshole,I asked for my money back since I wasn't going to be attending. H and her friends are calling me a petty person because me backing out will do damage to their budget and so on. But I don't see the problem here, so reddit am I really being unreasonable here??",
