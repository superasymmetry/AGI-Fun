    "inferences": "Here's an example that demonstrates the IKEA Effect and Sunk Cost Fallacy:\n\nImagine that Sarah buys a DIY bookshelf from IKEA for $50. She spends several hours assembling it, but it doesn't turn out as well as she expected. The shelves are a bit crooked, and the finish is not as smooth as she had hoped. Despite its flaws, Sarah feels a strong sense of attachment to the bookshelf because she invested her time and effort into building it. This is an example of the IKEA Effect, where Sarah overvalues the bookshelf because of the labor she put into it.\n\nLater, Sarah's friend offers to give her a brand new, perfectly assembled bookshelf for free. However, Sarah declines the offer because she feels that she has already invested $50 and several hours of her time into the DIY bookshelf. She thinks that if she accepts the new bookshelf, her investment will be wasted. This is an example of the Sunk Cost Fallacy, where Sarah is making a decision based on her past investment, rather than considering the current value of the new bookshelf.\n\nIn this example, there is no Demanding Bias, which refers to the tendency to demand more from a product or service because of its high price or prestige. The DIY bookshelf is not a luxury item, and Sarah is not demanding more from it because of its price. Instead, she is overvaluing it because of the labor she put into it, and she is reluctant to give it up because of her past investment.\n\nThis example demonstrates how the IKEA Effect and Sunk Cost Fallacy can influence our decision-making, leading us to overvalue things that we have invested time and effort into, and to make decisions based on past investments rather than current value."
