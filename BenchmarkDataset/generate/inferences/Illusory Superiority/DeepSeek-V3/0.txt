    "inferences": "Certainly! Here's a clear example that demonstrates both the **Fundamental Attribution Error (FAE)** and **Illusory Superiority**, while avoiding **Catastrophizing**:\n\n---\n\n### **Scenario: Workplace Meeting**  \nAt a team meeting, a colleague, Alex, arrives 10 minutes late.  \n\n#### **Fundamental Attribution Error (FAE)**:  \nYou immediately think, *\"Alex is so irresponsible and lazy\u2014they clearly don\u2019t care about punctuality.\"*  \nHere, you attribute Alex\u2019s lateness to their personality (an internal/dispositional cause) while ignoring possible external factors (e.g., traffic, a family emergency).  \n\n#### **Illusory Superiority**:  \nAt the same time, you reassure yourself, *\"I\u2019m always on time because I\u2019m way more professional and organized than most people here.\"*  \nThis is a self-enhancing bias where you overestimate your own punctuality and professionalism relative to others.  \n\n#### **Avoiding Catastrophizing**:  \nCritically, you **don\u2019t** spiral into thoughts like, *\"This is a disaster! The whole project will fail because Alex is unreliable!\"* (which would be catastrophizing\u2014exaggerating the negative consequences).  \n\n---\n\n### **Why This Works**:  \n- **FAE**: Blaming Alex\u2019s character instead of considering situational factors.  \n- **Illusory Superiority**: Believing you\u2019re better than others in the same context.  \n- **No Catastrophizing**: The example doesn\u2019t escalate to irrational worst-case scenarios.  \n\nWould you like a different context (e.g., driving, academics)?"
