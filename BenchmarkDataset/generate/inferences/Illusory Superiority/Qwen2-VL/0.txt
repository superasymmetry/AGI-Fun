    "prompt": "Generate an example that demonstrates the Black and White Thinking and Catastrophizing psychological biases, but that does not show the Normalcy Bias psychological bias.",
    "inferences": "Black and White Thinking: A person believes that they are either a complete success or a complete failure, with no middle ground. For example, a student who gets a B on a test may think that they are a complete failure and will never be able to succeed in the subject.\nCatastrophizing: A person tends to exaggerate the severity of a situation and assume the worst possible outcome. For example, a person who is running late for an appointment may catastrophize and think that they will lose their job or ruin their relationship because of being late.\nNormalcy Bias: A person tends to assume that things will always stay the same and that bad things won't happen to them. For example, a person who lives in an area prone to natural disasters may assume that they will never be affected by one and fail to take necessary precautions.\nExample: A person who is running late for an important meeting may catastrophize and think that they will lose their job or ruin their relationship because of being late. They may also engage in black and white thinking by believing that they are a complete failure if they are late, with no room for any other interpretation. However, they do not show normalcy bias because they are not assuming that being late will not happen to them."
