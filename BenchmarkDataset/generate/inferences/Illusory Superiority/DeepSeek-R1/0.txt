    "inferences": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create an example that demonstrates the Spotlight Effect and Demanding Bias but doesn't include the Sunk Cost Fallacy. Let me start by recalling what each of these biases means.\n\nThe Spotlight Effect is when people overestimate how much others notice their appearance or actions. Like thinking everyone noticed your bad hair day when really, no one did. \n\nDemanding Bias, which I think might be related to having unrealistic expectations of others, maybe expecting them to meet high standards without considering their perspective or limitations. Wait, actually, I should double-check. Oh, right, sometimes it's called the \"should\" bias, where someone imposes their own standards on others, believing others should act a certain way regardless of the situation.\n\nSunk Cost Fallacy is when someone continues a behavior because they've already invested resources (time, money, effort), even if it's not beneficial anymore. So I need to avoid any scenario where past investments influence current decisions.\n\nSo the example needs to show someone overestimating how much others are paying attention to them (Spotlight Effect) and also imposing their expectations on others (Demanding Bias). But without any element of continuing something because of past investment.\n\nLet me think of a common situation. Maybe a work or school presentation? Let's say someone gives a presentation and feels like everyone noticed their nervousness (Spotlight Effect). Then, they get upset with a colleague for not providing feedback, assuming the colleague should have known to help (Demanding Bias). \n\nWait, but why would the colleague not give feedback? Maybe the colleague was busy with their own work. The presenter assumes the colleague should have prioritized helping them, not considering the colleague's workload. That's Demanding Bias.\n\nIn this scenario, there's no element of the presenter continuing a project or task because of past investment. They just feel anxious and impose expectations. So no Sunk Cost here.\n\nLet me flesh this out. Alex gives a presentation, stumbles a bit, and thinks everyone noticed. Then, Alex gets mad at Jordan for not offering feedback, assuming Jordan should have known to help, even though Jordan was busy. Alex doesn't consider that Jordan had other priorities. \n\nYes, that seems to fit. Spotlight Effect in overestimating others' attention to his mistakes, Demanding Bias in expecting Jordan to act a certain way without considering Jordan's situation. And no Sunk Cost because there's no mention of Alex continuing something due to prior investment. \n\nI need to make sure there's no element where, say, Alex keeps working on the presentation because they already spent time on it. If the example stops at Alex feeling upset and criticizing Jordan, then Sunk Cost isn't involved. \n\nAnother check: Spotlight Effect is about perception of being noticed, Demanding Bias is about unrealistic expectations. The example should clearly show both. Maybe add details like Alex thinking everyone noticed his shaky hands, but in reality, few did. Then, Jordan was dealing with their own deadline, but Alex expected immediate feedback. \n\nYes, that works. The key is to avoid any continuation of action based on prior investment. The example should end with Alex's reactions, not with him persisting in a course of action because of sunk costs.\n</think>\n\n**Example Demonstrating Spotlight Effect and Demanding Bias:**  \n\n**Scenario:**  \nAlex, a new team member at work, gives a presentation to colleagues. During the talk, he stumbles over a few slides and feels his hands shaking. Afterward, he obsesses over his performance, convinced *everyone* noticed his nervousness and perceived flaws (Spotlight Effect). In reality, most attendees were focused on the content and barely registered his minor slip-ups.  \n\nLater, Alex approaches Jordan, a senior colleague, upset that Jordan didn\u2019t offer constructive feedback immediately after the meeting. Alex says, \u201cYou *should* have stayed behind to help me improve\u2014that\u2019s what a good mentor does!\u201d (Demanding Bias). He assumes Jordan\u2019s role obligates them to prioritize his needs, ignoring that Jordan was rushing to meet their own deadline. Alex never considers Jordan\u2019s workload or asks directly for feedback.  \n\n**Key Points:**  \n- **Spotlight Effect:** Alex overestimates how much others noticed his nervousness.  \n- **Demanding Bias:** He imposes unrealistic expectations on Jordan, assuming they \u201cshould\u201d act a certain way without communication or empathy.  \n- **No Sunk Cost Fallacy:** The example avoids any scenario where Alex (or others) continue a futile effort due to prior investment. His actions stem from anxiety and assumptions, not past resource commitments.  \n\nThis scenario cleanly isolates the two biases while excluding sunk cost reasoning."
