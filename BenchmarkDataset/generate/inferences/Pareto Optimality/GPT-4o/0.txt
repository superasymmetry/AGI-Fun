    "inferences": "To create a 3x3 payoff matrix with exactly 5 distinct Pareto optimal solutions, we need to ensure that five outcomes in the matrix can't be improved for one player without worsening the payoff for the other player. Each (Ai, Bi) pair should be unique. Here's one way to construct such a matrix:\n\nFirst, decide on which positions will be Pareto optimal:\n\n- Let's select (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (0,2), and (2,0) to be Pareto optimal.\n\nNow, assign increasing unique integers to each payoff, ensuring that swapping any of these positions with another violates Pareto optimality. For example:\n\n- (0,0) can be (10,2)\n- (0,1) can be (3,11)\n- (1,0) can be (7,10)\n- (0,2) can be (15,7)\n- (2,0) can be (11,15)\n\nFill in the remaining positions with payoffs that are not Pareto optimal:\n\n- (1,1) may have a higher combined payoff but both scores replaced by lower scores would reduce distinct Pareto optimality: (9,9)\n- Other positions can have lower combined payoffs or shared with Pareto levels in reverse for dominance reasons for non-Pareto such as: low dominance for (1,2) (5,4), (2,1) (4,5), (2,2) (6,6)\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (10,2), (3,11), (15,7) ],\n [ (7,10), (9,9), (5,4) ],\n [ (11,15), (4,5), (6,6) ]]\n<OUTPUT>",
