We can do this by making sure each remaining outcome is dominated by at least one of our Pareto optimal outcomes.\n\n3) The remaining positions will have lower numbers that are dominated by our Pareto optimal outcomes.\n\nLet's check the matrix:\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (8,7), (9,6), (2,3) ],\n [ (4,2), (7,8), (6,9) ],\n [ (1,4), (3,1), (5,5) ]]",
