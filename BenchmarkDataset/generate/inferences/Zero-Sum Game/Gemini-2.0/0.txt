    "inferences": "Okay, let's create a zero-sum game.  In a zero-sum game, the total gains of one player equal the total losses of the other player.  We'll structure this as a 3x3 payoff matrix for Player 1, and Player 2's payoff is simply the negative of Player 1's payoff.\n\nHere's the game:\n\n**Players:**\n\n*   Player 1 (Rows)\n*   Player 2 (Columns)\n\n**Actions:**\n\n*   Each player has 3 possible actions (Action 1, Action 2, Action 3).\n\n**Payoff Matrix for Player 1:**\n\nThis matrix shows what Player 1 receives (and therefore what Player 2 *loses*) for each combination of actions.\n\n```\n        Player 2\n       Action 1  Action 2  Action 3\nPlayer 1  -------------------------\nAction 1 |    5       -2       4\nAction 2 |    9        1       7\nAction 3 |   -3        6       0\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n*   **Rows represent Player 1's action choice.**  Action 1, Action 2, or Action 3.\n*   **Columns represent Player 2's action choice.** Action 1, Action 2, or Action 3.\n*   **The values in the matrix represent Player 1's payoff.**  For example, if Player 1 chooses Action 1 and Player 2 chooses Action 1, Player 1 gets a payoff of 5.\n*   **The payoff for Player 2 is simply the negative of the corresponding value in the matrix.** For example, if Player 1 chooses Action 1 and Player 2 chooses Action 1, Player 2 gets a payoff of -5.\n\n**Verification of the requirement:**\n\nIf Player 1 takes Action 2, then the payoffs for Player 1 are [9, 1, 7] if Player 2 takes Actions 1, 2, and 3, respectively.\n\n**Zero-Sum Property:**\n\nFor any given pair of actions, the sum of Player 1's payoff and Player 2's payoff is always zero.  For example:\n\n*   If Player 1 chooses Action 1 and Player 2 chooses Action 2:\n    *   Player 1's payoff = -2\n    *   Player 2's payoff = 2\n    *   Sum = -2 + 2 = 0\n\nThis holds true for all combinations of actions, confirming that this is indeed a zero-sum game.",
