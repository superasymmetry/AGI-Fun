    "inferences": "To generate a zero-sum game, we need to ensure that the payoffs for Player 1 and Player 2 sum up to zero for each possible action combination. Since Player 1 receives a payoff of [8, 9, 7] if the other player takes the corresponding actions, we can assume these payoffs are for the first row of the matrix. \n\nFor a zero-sum game, the payoffs for Player 2 would be the negative of the payoffs for Player 1. So, if Player 1 receives 8, 9, and 7, then Player 2 would receive -8, -9, and -7 respectively.\n\nHere's a possible 3x3 payoff matrix:\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (8, -8), (9, -9), (7, -7) ],\n [ (-3, 3), (2, -2), (1, -1) ],\n [ (4, -4), (-5, 5), (6, -6) ]]",
