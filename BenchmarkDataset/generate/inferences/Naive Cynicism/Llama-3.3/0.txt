    "inferences": "Here's an example that demonstrates the IKEA Effect and Illusory Superiority psychological biases without showing the Sunk Cost Fallacy:\n\nImagine two friends, Alex and Ben, who both want to build their own bookshelves. They go to a furniture store and find two different options: a pre-assembled bookshelf and a DIY bookshelf kit from IKEA.\n\nAlex decides to buy the pre-assembled bookshelf, which costs $100. Ben, on the other hand, chooses the DIY bookshelf kit, which costs $80. Ben spends several hours assembling the bookshelf, following the instructions and using his own skills to get it just right.\n\nWhen they both finish, they show their bookshelves to their mutual friend, Chris. Chris is impressed with both bookshelves, but Ben is particularly proud of his DIY bookshelf. Ben says, \"I built this bookshelf myself, and it's the best one I've ever seen. The design is perfect, and the quality is top-notch.\" Alex, on the other hand, says, \"I bought this pre-assembled bookshelf, and it's nice, but I'm not sure if it's the best one out there.\"\n\nIn this example, the IKEA Effect is demonstrated by Ben's tendency to overvalue his DIY bookshelf simply because he built it himself. He's more proud of his bookshelf and thinks it's of higher quality, even though it may not be objectively better than Alex's pre-assembled bookshelf.\n\nThe Illusory Superiority bias is also demonstrated by Ben's belief that his DIY bookshelf is the best one he's ever seen. He's overestimating his own abilities and the quality of his bookshelf, thinking that it's superior to others.\n\nHowever, this example does not demonstrate the Sunk Cost Fallacy, because neither Alex nor Ben is reluctant to get rid of their bookshelf or change their decision, even if it's not perfect. They're not throwing good money after bad or holding onto something just because they've invested time or resources into it. Ben is simply proud of his DIY bookshelf, and Alex is happy with his pre-assembled one."
