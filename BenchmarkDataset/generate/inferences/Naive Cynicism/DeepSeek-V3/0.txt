    "inferences": "Certainly! Here's an example that demonstrates both the **Spotlight Effect** and the **IKEA Effect**, while avoiding the **Demanding Bias**:\n\n---\n\n### **Example: Handmade Gift for a Friend**  \n\n**Scenario:**  \nAlex spends hours knitting a scarf for their friend Jamie. They put a lot of effort into choosing the yarn, learning new stitches, and making sure the scarf looks perfect.  \n\n#### **Spotlight Effect (Overestimating How Much Others Notice You)**  \nWhen Alex gives the scarf to Jamie, they feel self-conscious, worrying that Jamie will notice every tiny mistake (e.g., a slightly uneven stitch or a loose thread). In reality, Jamie is delighted with the gift and doesn\u2019t notice the imperfections\u2014Alex\u2019s self-focused anxiety is exaggerated.  \n\n#### **IKEA Effect (Valuing Something More Because You Put Effort Into It)**  \nBecause Alex invested so much time and effort into making the scarf, they value it much more than if they had bought one from a store. They might even assume Jamie will cherish it more than a store-bought gift, even though Jamie might not feel the same emotional attachment to the handmade item.  \n\n#### **Avoiding Demanding Bias (Expecting Others to Meet Unrealistic Standards)**  \nAlex does **not** expect Jamie to react in a specific, overly enthusiastic way (e.g., \"You should love this more than any other gift!\"). They simply hope Jamie will like it, without imposing unfair expectations. This keeps the interaction free from the **Demanding Bias**, where someone pressures others to meet their high standards.  \n\n---\n\n### **Why This Works:**  \n- **Spotlight Effect:** Alex overestimates how much Jamie will scrutinize the scarf.  \n- **IKEA Effect:** Alex overvalues the scarf due to their personal effort.  \n- **No Demanding Bias:** Alex doesn\u2019t impose rigid expectations on Jamie\u2019s reaction.  \n\nThis example cleanly isolates the two biases while avoiding the third. Let me know if you'd like any refinements!"
