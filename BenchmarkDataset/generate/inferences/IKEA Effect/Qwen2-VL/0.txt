    "inferences": "One example that demonstrates the Demanding Bias and Sunk Cost Fallacy psychological biases, but not the Illusory Superiority bias, is the following:\nA person invests a significant amount of money in a new business venture that they believe will be successful. However, after several months, the business is not performing as well as expected and is losing money. Despite this, the person continues to invest more money into the business, convinced that it will eventually turn around and become profitable. This is an example of the Demanding Bias, as the person is holding onto their belief in the success of the business despite evidence to the contrary.\nAt the same time, the person is also falling prey to the Sunk Cost Fallacy, as they are continuing to invest money into the business in an attempt to recoup their initial investment, even though it is unlikely to be successful. This is a common mistake that people make when they have already invested a significant amount of time, money, or effort into something and feel that they cannot abandon it without losing everything they have put into it.\nIn this example, the person is not demonstrating the Illusory Superiority bias, as they are not overestimating their own abilities or believing that they are better than others. Instead, they are simply holding onto their belief in the success of the business and continuing to invest in it despite evidence to the contrary."
