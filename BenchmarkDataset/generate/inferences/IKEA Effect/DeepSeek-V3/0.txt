    "inferences": "Here\u2019s an example that demonstrates the **Sunk Cost Fallacy** and **Endowment Effect** without invoking the **Spotlight Effect**:\n\n---\n\n### **Example: A Concert Ticket and a Rare Vinyl Record**  \n\n1. **Sunk Cost Fallacy**:  \n   - *Scenario*: Alex buys a $100 ticket to a concert but wakes up on the day of the event feeling sick. Despite knowing they won\u2019t enjoy it and could rest instead, Alex insists on going because they \"already paid for it.\"  \n   - *Bias*: Alex is influenced by the sunk cost (the non-refundable $100) rather than making a rational decision based on current well-being.  \n\n2. **Endowment Effect**:  \n   - *Scenario*: Alex owns a rare vinyl record they bought years ago for $50. A collector offers $200 for it, but Alex refuses, insisting it\u2019s worth at least $300 to them\u2014even though they wouldn\u2019t pay that much to buy it if they didn\u2019t already own it.  \n   - *Bias*: Alex overvalues the record simply because they own it, demonstrating the endowment effect.  \n\n3. **Absence of Spotlight Effect**:  \n   - Neither scenario involves Alex worrying about how others are judging them (e.g., \"Will people think I\u2019m wasteful if I skip the concert?\" or \"Does the collector think I\u2019m greedy?\"). The decisions are purely about personal loss aversion or ownership bias, not perceived social scrutiny.  \n\n---\n\n### Why This Works:  \n- **Sunk Cost Fallacy**: Irrational commitment based on past investment.  \n- **Endowment Effect**: Overvaluing owned items beyond market value.  \n- **No Spotlight Effect**: No concern about others\u2019 opinions\u2014just internal biases.  \n\nThis keeps the focus on economic/behavioral biases without introducing social self-consciousness."
