    "inferences": "Okay, here's an example that incorporates both the Demanding Bias and the Sunk Cost Fallacy, while avoiding the Spotlight Effect:\n\n**Scenario:**\n\nLet's say you're running a small catering business.\n\n**The Sunk Cost Fallacy:**\n\nYou decide to invest heavily in a new line of \"gourmet fusion tacos.\" You spend $5,000 on specialized equipment (a custom tortilla press, a fancy grilling setup, and unique ingredient storage), design a high-end menu with intricate descriptions, and even hire a chef specifically skilled in fusion cuisine.  You feel committed to these tacos due to the high initial investment.\n\n**The Demanding Bias:**\n\nEarly reviews are mixed. Customers compliment the presentation but often complain about the flavors being \"too adventurous\" or \"overpriced.\"  Instead of simplifying the tacos or changing the menu, you become convinced that *more* investment is needed.  You think, \"If I just added this *one* exotic spice blend from a hard-to-find importer ($1,000 expense), *then* people would appreciate the vision!\" You also start pushing your sales team to aggressively promote the taco line, even though they express concerns that it's not what customers are asking for. You believe that if you just \"demand\" that people try and appreciate your tacos, they will eventually see their value. You spend more money on targeted ads, special offers, and even give the tacos away for free at events \u2013 all to drive up demand for a product that fundamentally isn't resonating with your target audience.\n\n**Why this avoids the Spotlight Effect:**\n\nThe story doesn't rely on the catering business owner overestimating how much customers notice them or their decisions. The issue isn't that they think everyone is constantly scrutinizing their taco business; instead, it's their overestimation of how demanding/forceful promotion can overcome the actual lack of demand.\n"
