    "inferences": "Let me help create a 3x3 payoff matrix demonstrating strict dominance for Player 2 only.\n\nFirst, let's recall that a strictly dominant strategy is one that gives a player strictly better payoffs than any other strategy, regardless of what other players do.\n\nFor Player 2, we want Column 1 to be strictly dominant with payoffs [7,4,6]. This means that:\n- B1 must be greater than B2 and B3 (7 > other numbers in row 1)\n- B4 must be greater than B5 and B6 (4 > other numbers in row 2)\n- B7 must be greater than B8 and B9 (6 > other numbers in row 3)\n\nFor Player 1, we don't want any row to be strictly dominant, so we'll need to mix up the payoffs to avoid any row being consistently better than others.\n\nHere's my solution:\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (3,7), (5,2), (4,3) ],\n [ (2,4), (6,1), (3,2) ],\n [ (4,6), (2,3), (5,1) ]]",
