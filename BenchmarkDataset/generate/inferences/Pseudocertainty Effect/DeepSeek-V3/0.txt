    "inferences": "Certainly! Here\u2019s an example that demonstrates **Black-and-White Thinking** (all-or-nothing reasoning) and **Catastrophizing** (assuming the worst possible outcome) while avoiding the **Endowment Effect** (overvaluing what one already owns):\n\n---\n\n### **Scenario: Job Interview Feedback**  \n**Black-and-White Thinking:**  \nAlex applies for a competitive job and receives a rejection email. They think:  \n*\"I completely failed this interview. I\u2019m terrible at everything, and I\u2019ll never get a good job.\"*  \nHere, Alex sees the rejection as total failure (black) with no middle ground (white), ignoring any positive aspects of their performance or future opportunities.\n\n**Catastrophizing:**  \nAlex spirals further:  \n*\"This is a disaster! Now I\u2019ll be unemployed forever, end up homeless, and my career is ruined.\"*  \nThey jump to the worst imaginable outcome without evidence, blowing the setback out of proportion.\n\n**Why the Endowment Effect is Absent:**  \nThe Endowment Effect involves valuing something more simply because you own it (e.g., overestimating the worth of your old car). Here, Alex isn\u2019t overvaluing a possession or prior job\u2014they\u2019re distorting their self-worth and future prospects, which aligns with the other two biases.\n\n---\n\n### Key Differences:  \n- **Black-and-White Thinking:** \"I\u2019m a total failure.\" (No nuance.)  \n- **Catastrophizing:** \"This will ruin my life.\" (Worst-case assumption.)  \n- **No Endowment Effect:** No attachment to owned items or prior status is involved.  \n\nThis example cleanly isolates the two biases while excluding the third. Let me know if you'd like refinements!"
