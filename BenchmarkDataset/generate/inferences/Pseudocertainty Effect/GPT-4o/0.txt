    "inferences": "**Scenario:**\n\nEmma recently started a new job at a marketing firm. She is eager to make a great impression and feels the pressure to succeed.\n\n**Demanding Bias:**\n\nEmma believes that everything in her work environment should be perfectly organized and manageable. She expects that her tasks should always be clear, timelines reasonable, and support readily available from her colleagues. When she encounters a project that is poorly defined, she becomes frustrated and thinks, \"This should be better organized! How can they expect me to work under these conditions?\"\n\n**Catastrophizing:**\n\nOn her second week, Emma was tasked with preparing a presentation for a major client. A technical glitch delayed her from starting on time. Emma immediately spiraled into panic, thinking, \"If this presentation isn't perfect, I'll mess everything up. I'll surely get criticized by my boss, and it will ruin my chances of ever moving up in this company. What if I even lose my job over this?\"\n\n**Absence of Pseudocertainty Effect:**\n\nEmma is offered a choice by her boss: she could either take on a risky project that has a high potential for significant rewards or handle a less risky project with modest, guaranteed success. Given her anxiety about the presentation and her general concern about being evaluated harshly, Emma carefully considers both options and ultimately chooses the project that aligns best with her skills and future growth prospects, rather than defaulting to an option because it feels safer or more certain at that moment."
