    "inferences": "Okay, here's an example that highlights the IKEA Effect and Spotlight Effect, while avoiding Catastrophizing:\n\n**Scenario:**\n\nSarah is hosting a small dinner party for three close friends to celebrate her new promotion.  She decides to try making a complex, multi-layered lasagna from scratch, following a recipe she found online.  The recipe is quite involved, requiring her to make her own pasta, ricotta cheese from scratch, and a long-simmering meat sauce. The process takes her almost an entire day, and she encounters several challenges: the pasta dough is too sticky, the ricotta curdles slightly, and the sauce burns a little bit on the bottom of the pot.\n\nDespite these difficulties, Sarah perseveres and eventually assembles the lasagna.  She's exhausted but also incredibly proud of herself for tackling such a challenging dish.\n\nWhen her friends arrive, she serves the lasagna with a flourish.  She's intensely aware of every tiny imperfection in the lasagna \u2013 the slightly uneven layers, the slightly burnt smell, and the little bit of ricotta that is more watery than creamy.\n\n**The IKEA Effect in Action:**\n\nSarah, because she invested so much time, effort, and problem-solving into making the lasagna, **overvalues** it.  She thinks it's significantly better than it actually is. Even though she knows there are imperfections, she feels a deep sense of satisfaction and accomplishment that biases her perception of its quality.  She thinks to herself, \"This is the *best* lasagna they will ever have, I put so much work into it, they must be blown away by it!\"\n\n**The Spotlight Effect in Action:**\n\nWhile serving the lasagna, Sarah is **convinced** that her friends are hyper-focused on every flaw. She believes that her friends are noticing her slight hand tremor from tiredness, the smudge of sauce on her apron, and every detail in the lasagna. She's sure they'll notice the slightly burnt smell. She thinks they are judging her.\n\nIn reality, her friends are enjoying the evening and the lasagna. They are impressed she made it from scratch, they are happy to be celebrating with her and they comment that it is delicious and they love it. They don't notice the minor imperfections as much as Sarah does, and they're certainly not judging her as harshly as she fears.\n\n**Why this avoids Catastrophizing:**\n\nCatastrophizing would involve Sarah thinking something like: \"If they don't like the lasagna, they will think I'm a terrible cook, and then they'll stop being my friends, and I'll be alone forever.\"\n\nThe example above focuses on the overestimation of the lasagna's quality and the exaggerated belief that her flaws are under intense scrutiny, *without* jumping to extreme and irrational conclusions about the long-term consequences of those perceived flaws. Sarah feels worried, but the worry is contained to the immediate situation and doesn't extrapolate into a broader sense of impending doom or disaster. She is only worried about making a good impression on her friends.\n"
