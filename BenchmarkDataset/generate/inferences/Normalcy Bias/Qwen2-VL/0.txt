They also believe that all politicians are corrupt and that there is no point in voting because nothing will ever change. However, they do not make the Fundamental Attribution Error, which is the tendency to attribute other people's behavior to their personality or character rather than to situational factors. In this example, the person does not attribute the failure of politicians to their character, but rather to the system or the situation."
