    "inferences": "Certainly! Here's an example that demonstrates both the **Normalcy Bias** and the **Spotlight Effect**, while avoiding **Naive Cynicism**:\n\n---\n\n### **Scenario: A Student During a Fire Drill**  \n\n**Normalcy Bias:**  \nDuring a scheduled fire drill at school, Alex assumes it\u2019s just another routine practice and doesn\u2019t react quickly. Even though alarms are blaring, Alex continues packing their bag slowly, thinking, *\"This is probably just a drill like last time\u2014no real danger.\"* This reflects **Normalcy Bias**\u2014the tendency to underestimate or dismiss potential threats because the situation feels familiar or routine.  \n\n**Spotlight Effect:**  \nMeanwhile, Alex trips slightly while walking out of the classroom and feels embarrassed, convinced that *everyone* noticed and is judging them. In reality, most classmates were focused on exiting the building and didn\u2019t pay attention. This is the **Spotlight Effect**\u2014overestimating how much others notice or scrutinize our actions.  \n\n**Avoiding Naive Cynicism:**  \nNotice that Alex doesn\u2019t assume their classmates are deliberately ignoring them out of malice or indifference (which would be **Naive Cynicism**\u2014the tendency to assume others' actions are more selfishly motivated than they are). Instead, Alex\u2019s worry stems from self-consciousness, not distrust of others.  \n\n---\n\n### **Key Takeaways:**  \n- **Normalcy Bias:** Underreacting to a potential emergency because it feels routine.  \n- **Spotlight Effect:** Overestimating how much others notice minor mistakes.  \n- **No Naive Cynicism:** No assumption that peers are acting with hidden negativity.  \n\nThis example cleanly separates the three biases while illustrating the first two effectively. Let me know if you'd like any refinements!"
