Yet, the moment the nectar touches one\u2019s lips, the earth beneath them withers, turning to dust. The more one drinks, the more the land dies\u2014until the drinker stands alone in a barren wasteland, forever young, forever cursed.  \n\n*\"The earth gives, the earth takes.\"*  \n\nThose who seek the nectar find life, but in taking it, they destroy the very world that sustains them. A paradox of greed and survival, where immortality comes at the cost of all that is alive.  \n\n*\"The earth gives, the earth takes.\"*"
