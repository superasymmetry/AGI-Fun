We'd been inseparable as kids, best friends, yet he was now a ghost, a shimmering echo of a boy who died ten years ago. And here he was, smiling, beckoning me to a moment that both was and wasn't real, a moment that threatened to erase all the moments that followed his tragic end. To be his friend again meant ceasing to be the person I'd become without him.\n"
