    "inferences": "Hyperbaton is a literary device that involves the reversal or alteration of the normal word order in a sentence, often for emphasis or effect. Here's an instance of hyperbaton that fits your theme:\n\n\"With luminous light, lovely laughter lifts lively ladies.\"\n\nIn this example, the normal word order is altered to create a sense of playfulness and emphasis on the theme of happiness. The alliteration of \"l\" sounds adds to the musicality and joyfulness of the phrase, while the word \"light\" is used to convey a sense of brightness and warmth. The hyperbaton creates a sense of surprise and delight, drawing attention to the idea that happiness can be found in the simplest things, like laughter and light."
