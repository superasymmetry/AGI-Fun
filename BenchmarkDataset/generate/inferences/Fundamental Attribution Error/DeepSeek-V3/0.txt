    "inferences": "Certainly! Here's a clear example that demonstrates both the **Sunk Cost Fallacy** and the **IKEA Effect**, while avoiding the **Endowment Effect**:\n\n---\n\n### **Example: Building a DIY Bookshelf**  \n\n**Scenario:**  \nAlex buys a DIY bookshelf kit from IKEA for $100 and spends 5 hours assembling it. Halfway through, Alex realizes the bookshelf is wobbly and poorly designed\u2014it won\u2019t hold books securely. Despite this, Alex continues assembling it because:  \n\n1. **Sunk Cost Fallacy** \u2013 Alex thinks, *\"I\u2019ve already spent $100 and 5 hours on this; I can\u2019t quit now!\"* (Ignoring that the money and time are already lost and continuing is irrational.)  \n2. **IKEA Effect** \u2013 Because Alex put effort into building it, they overvalue the bookshelf (*\"I made this, so it must be good!\"*), even though it\u2019s objectively flawed.  \n\n**Why the Endowment Effect is NOT present:**  \nThe **Endowment Effect** would mean Alex values the bookshelf more *simply because they own it*, even if they hadn\u2019t built it. But in this case, Alex\u2019s overvaluation stems from their **effort** (IKEA Effect) and **prior investment** (Sunk Cost), not mere ownership. If Alex had bought a pre-assembled, defective bookshelf and still refused to return it just because it was *theirs*, that would show the Endowment Effect\u2014but that\u2019s not happening here.  \n\n---\n\n### **Key Differences:**  \n- **Sunk Cost Fallacy:** Continuing due to past investments (time/money).  \n- **IKEA Effect:** Overvaluing something because of personal effort.  \n- **No Endowment Effect:** Alex isn\u2019t valuing it just because they own it\u2014their attachment comes from effort and sunk costs.  \n\nThis example cleanly isolates the two biases while excluding the third. Let me know if you'd like refinements!"
