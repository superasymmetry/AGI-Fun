    "inferences": "Here's an example that demonstrates Black and White Thinking and Demanding Bias without showing Illusory Superiority:\n\nMeet Emma, a student who is very particular about her academic performance. She believes that if she doesn't get an A+ on every exam, she is a complete failure. In her mind, there's no middle ground - either she's perfect, or she's a total failure. This is an example of Black and White Thinking, where Emma sees things in absolute terms, without considering the possibility of partial success or shades of gray.\n\nAdditionally, Emma has very high expectations for herself and others. She demands that her professors provide her with detailed feedback on every assignment, and that her classmates meet her high standards of academic rigor. If they don't, she becomes frustrated and disappointed, feeling that they are not living up to her expectations. This is an example of Demanding Bias, where Emma has unrealistic expectations for herself and others, and becomes overly critical when those expectations are not met.\n\nIn this example, Emma is not demonstrating Illusory Superiority, because she is not overestimating her own abilities or performance relative to others. She is actually quite self-critical, and her Black and White Thinking leads her to focus on her own perceived shortcomings rather than comparing herself favorably to others. Instead, her biases are focused on her own internal standards and expectations, and how she perceives herself and others in relation to those standards."
