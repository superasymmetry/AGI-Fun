    "inferences": "Example: \n\nSamantha is a high school student who is preparing for her final exams. She has been studying for weeks, but she is still worried that she will not do well on the exams. She has been told by her teachers that the exams will be difficult, and she has heard from her classmates that many of them are feeling anxious about the exams as well. \n\nOn the day of the exams, Samantha arrives at school feeling nervous and overwhelmed. She sits down at her desk and begins to read the first question on the exam. As she reads, she starts to feel more and more anxious. She tells herself that she will never be able to answer the question correctly, and that she will fail the exam. She catastrophizes the situation, imagining that if she fails the exam, she will not be able to get into college and her entire future will be ruined. \n\nSamantha's negative thoughts and feelings are an example of the Fundamental Attribution Error, which is the tendency to attribute other people's behavior to their personal characteristics rather than situational factors. In this case, Samantha is attributing her anxiety and fear to her own personal characteristics, rather than the fact that the exam is difficult and many other students are also feeling anxious. \n\nSamantha's catastrophizing is also an example of the Catastrophizing psychological bias, which is the tendency to assume that the worst possible outcome will occur. In this case, Samantha is assuming that she will fail the exam and that this will ruin her future, even though there are many other possible outcomes. \n\nHowever, this example does not show the Black and White Thinking psychological bias, which is the tendency to see things in absolute terms, such as \"good\" or \"bad,\" \"right\" or \"wrong.\" Samantha's thoughts and feelings are more nuanced than this, and she is not seeing the situation in black and white terms."
