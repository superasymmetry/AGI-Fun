    "inferences": "Certainly! Here's an example that demonstrates the **Sunk Cost Fallacy** and **Overconfidence Bias**, while avoiding **Mental Filtering (Disqualifying the Positive)**:\n\n---\n\n### **Example: A Failing Business Venture**  \n\n**Scenario:**  \nAlex has invested $50,000 into a startup over the past two years. Despite consistent losses and negative feedback from customers, Alex refuses to shut it down, believing that \"quitting now would mean wasting all that money.\"  \n\n**Sunk Cost Fallacy:**  \nAlex continues pouring money into the failing business because of the time and resources already invested, rather than objectively evaluating its future prospects.  \n\n**Overconfidence Bias:**  \nAlex insists, \"I know this will turn around soon\u2014I just need one more big client!\" despite overwhelming evidence that the business model is flawed.  \n\n**Why This Avoids Mental Filtering:**  \nMental Filtering would involve Alex **ignoring or dismissing any positive aspects** of the situation (e.g., learning valuable lessons from the experience, networking gains). However, in this example, Alex is simply overconfident and stuck on sunk costs\u2014not actively disregarding positive outcomes.  \n\n---\n\n### **Key Differences:**  \n- **Sunk Cost Fallacy:** Sticking with a bad decision due to past investments.  \n- **Overconfidence Bias:** Overestimating future success despite evidence.  \n- **No Mental Filtering:** Alex isn\u2019t *dismissing* positives\u2014they\u2019re just not the focus.  \n\nThis keeps the example clean while highlighting the two biases effectively. Let me know if you'd like any refinements!"
