The matrix must be a valid representation of a game in game theory.                             It must be in the following format:\n\n[[ (A1,B1), (A2,B2), (A3,B3) ],\n [ (A4,B4), (A5,B5), (A6,B6) ],\n [ (A7,B7), (A8,B8), (A9,B9) ]]\n\nWhere Ai and Bi represent the non-negative,                             integer-valued payoffs for Player 1 and Player 2 respectively.
