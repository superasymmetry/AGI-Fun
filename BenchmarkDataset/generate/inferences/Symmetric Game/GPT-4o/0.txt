    "inferences": "In a symmetric game, the payoffs for Player 1 and Player 2 are such that the roles can be reversed, and the payoffs remain the same. We need to construct a 3x3 payoff matrix where, if Player 2 takes the third action (i.e., the third column), their payoffs should be [1, 0, 2] corresponding to the first, second, and third actions of Player 1, respectively. Similarly, if Player 1 takes the third action (i.e., the third row), we should ensure Player 1 receives payoffs of [1, 0, 2] corresponding to the first, second, and third actions of Player 2. Additionally, the matrix should be symmetric.\n\nHere is a 3x3 payoff matrix that satisfies these conditions:\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (3,3), (2,1), (1,1) ],\n [ (1,2), (2,2), (0,0) ],\n [ (1,2), (0,0), (2,2) ]]\n<OUTPUT>",

It must be in the following format:\n\n[[ (A1,B1), (A2,B2), (A3,B3) ],\n [ (A4,B4), (A5,B5), (A6,B6) ],\n [ (A7,B7), (A8,B8), (A9,B9) ]]\n\nWhere Ai and Bi represent the non-negative,                             integer-valued payoffs for Player 1 and Player 2 respectively.
