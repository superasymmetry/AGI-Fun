Assign unique integers to all payoff entries, ensuring that for Player 2, when they choose their third action, the expected payoff is higher compared to when they choose their first or second action.\n2. Use permutations to fill in the remaining entries while keeping the constraint of uniqueness for all payoff values.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (1,18), (2,3), (7,8) ],\n [ (4,19), (5,6), (9,10) ],\n [ (12,11), (13,14), (15,16) ]]\n",
