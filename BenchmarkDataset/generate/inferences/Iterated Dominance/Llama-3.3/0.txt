    "inferences": "To demonstrate the concept of Iterated Dominance, let's start with a 2x3 matrix. In this example, Player 1 has two strategies (Row 1 and Row 2), and Player 2 has three strategies (Column 1, Column 2, and Column 3). The payoffs for each player are represented by the pairs (A, B), where A is the payoff for Player 1 and B is the payoff for Player 2.\n\nInitially, our 2x3 matrix looks like this:\n[[ (3, 2), (2, 4), (1, 1) ],\n[ (4, 3), (3, 2), (2, 5) ]]\n\nIn this matrix, we can see that for Player 2, playing Column 3 (payoffs (1, 1) and (2, 5)) is not strictly dominated by any other strategy because it offers the highest payoff for Player 2 in the second row. However, for Player 1, there isn't a strictly dominated strategy in the rows. For Player 2, Column 1 is not strictly dominated, but Column 2 is strictly dominated by Column 3 for Player 2 because regardless of what Player 1 chooses, Column 3 offers a higher or equal payoff for Player 2 compared to Column 2.\n\nAfter eliminating Column 2 (since it's strictly dominated by Column 3 for Player 2), our new matrix becomes:\n[[ (3, 2), (1, 1) ],\n[ (4, 3), (2, 5) ]]\n\nNow, looking at this 2x2 matrix, we can see that for Player 1, Row 1 is not strictly dominated, but Row 2 offers a higher payoff when Player 2 chooses Column 1 and a lower payoff when Player 2 chooses Column 3. However, for Player 2, Column 1 is strictly dominated by Column 3 because regardless of Player 1's choice, Column 3 offers a higher payoff for Player 2.\n\nAfter eliminating Column 1, our final matrix becomes:\n[[ (1, 1) ],\n[ (2, 5) ]]\n\nThis final 1x2 matrix represents the game after iterated elimination of strictly dominated strategies.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (3, 2), (2, 4), (1, 1) ], [ (4, 3), (3, 2), (2, 5) ]],\n[[ (3, 2), (1, 1) ], [ (4, 3), (2, 5) ]],\n[[ (1, 1) ], [ (2, 5) ]]",

In the final output, the following constraints must be met: Generate a list of payoff matrices that meets the provided conditions. The matrices must be a valid representation of a game                             in game theory.
