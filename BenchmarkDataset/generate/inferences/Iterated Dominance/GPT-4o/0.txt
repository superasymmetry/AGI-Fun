    "inferences": "In the concept of iterated dominance in game theory, we start with a payoff matrix and remove strictly dominated strategies to simplify the game. Here's an example, starting from a 4x2 matrix and ending with a 1x1 matrix:\n\nAn initial 4x2 payoff matrix:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n(3,2) & (2,1) \\\\\n(1,3) & (4,4) \\\\\n(0,2) & (2,2) \\\\\n(5,0) & (3,1) \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\n1. From the 1st column, strategy 1 for Player 1 is dominated by strategy 4 in terms of higher payoffs for each strategy of Player 2. Similarly, in column 2, strategy 2 for Player 2 dominates strategy 1. Therefore, we remove the dominated strategies and simplify to:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n(1,3) & (4,4) \\\\\n(0,2) & (2,2) \\\\\n(5,0) & (3,1) \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\n2. Now we compare strategies in columns 3 and remove any that are strictly dominated. In this case, row 2 is dominated by row 3 for Player 1 in both columns, and likewise, in the 2nd column, strategy 3 for Player 2 dominates all others.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n(1,3) & (4,4) \\\\\n(5,0) & (3,1) \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\n3. At this stage, we compare the remaining strategies. Row 1 is dominated by row 2 for Player 1 in both columns.\n\nEnding with:\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n(5,0) & (3,1) \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nProceed to remove strategies further if applicable. In this 2x1 matrix, no further strictly dominated strategies exist, and we reach a final 1x1 matrix by objectively looking at remaining payoffs for Player 2.\n\nSo, starting from a 4x2 matrix, we iteratively remove dominated strategies until we are left with a 1x1 matrix representing the most simplified form of the game with no dominated strategies.\n\n<OUTPUT>[[ (3,2), (2,1) ], [ (1,3), (4,4) ], [ (0,2), (2,2) ], [ (5,0), (3,1) ]], [[ (1,3), (4,4) ], [ (0,2), (2,2) ], [ (5,0), (3,1) ]], [[ (1,3), (4,4) ], [ (5,0), (3,1) ]], [[ (5,0) ]]",
