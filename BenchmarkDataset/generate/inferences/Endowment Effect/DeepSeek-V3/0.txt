Endowment Effect:**  \nSarah owns a well-used economics textbook from her freshman year. Even though the current market value is $30, she insists on selling it for $50 because she feels it\u2019s \"worth more\" to her\u2014she highlights her handwritten notes and the sentimental value. Meanwhile, her classmate Jake, who is buying the same book, thinks $30 is fair and balks at her price. Sarah overvalues the book simply because she owns it (Endowment Effect).  \n\n**2. Fundamental Attribution Error:**  \nWhen Jake refuses to pay $50, Sarah assumes he\u2019s \"cheap\" or \"doesn\u2019t appreciate good study materials.\" She attributes his reluctance to personality flaws rather than considering situational factors (e.g., Jake might be on a tight budget or found a cheaper copy online). This is the Fundamental Attribution Error\u2014overemphasizing personality traits and underestimating external circumstances.  \n\n**Why Catastrophizing Isn\u2019t Present:**  \nSarah doesn\u2019t spiral into irrational worst-case scenarios (e.g., \"No one will ever buy my book, and I\u2019ll fail financially!\"). She simply overvalues her possession and misjudges Jake\u2019s motives\u2014neither of which involves exaggerated negative predictions.  \n\n---\n\nThis example cleanly isolates the two biases while avoiding catastrophizing. Let me know if you'd like refinements!"
