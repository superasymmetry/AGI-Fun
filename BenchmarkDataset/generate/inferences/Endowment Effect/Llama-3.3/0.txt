    "inferences": "Here's an example that demonstrates the Fundamental Attribution Error and Spotlight Effect psychological biases:\n\nImagine that Emily, a college student, is attending a party with her friends. As she's walking to the kitchen to grab a drink, she accidentally spills her own drink on her shirt. She feels embarrassed and quickly excuses herself to go clean up.\n\nLater, when Emily's friend, Sarah, asks her what happened, Emily explains that she was just really clumsy and always seems to be spilling things. However, when Sarah mentions that another partygoer, Jack, spilled his drink on the carpet, Emily attributes it to the fact that the carpet was slippery and the lighting in the room was poor.\n\nIn this example, Emily is demonstrating the Fundamental Attribution Error. When it comes to her own behavior (spilling her drink), she attributes it to her internal disposition (being clumsy). However, when it comes to Jack's behavior (spilling his drink), she attributes it to external factors (the slippery carpet and poor lighting).\n\nAt the same time, Emily is also experiencing the Spotlight Effect. She feels like everyone at the party is staring at her and noticing her embarrassing moment, even though they're probably not paying much attention to her at all. She's overestimating the extent to which others are noticing her and her mistake.\n\nThis example does not demonstrate Black and White Thinking, as Emily is not viewing the situation in absolute terms (e.g., \"I'm always clumsy\" vs. \"I'm never clumsy\"). Instead, she's making more nuanced attributions about her own behavior and the behavior of others, while still falling prey to the Fundamental Attribution Error and Spotlight Effect biases."
