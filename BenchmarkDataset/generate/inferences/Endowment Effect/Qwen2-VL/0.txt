    "inferences": "Catastrophizing bias is a tendency to exaggerate the severity of a situation or event, while demanding bias is a tendency to have unrealistic expectations and demand perfection from oneself or others. Here's an example that demonstrates both biases but does not show the IKEA Effect:\n\nSuppose a person is planning a trip and is worried about getting lost or encountering unexpected problems along the way. They may catastrophize the situation by imagining the worst-case scenario, such as getting lost in a dangerous area or running out of food and water. They may also have unrealistic expectations for themselves, demanding that they plan every detail of the trip perfectly and that nothing goes wrong.\n\nFor example, they may spend hours researching the best route and accommodations, only to become frustrated when they encounter unexpected delays or changes in plans. They may also be overly critical of themselves if they make a mistake or if something doesn't go according to plan, blaming themselves for not being perfect.\n\nThis example demonstrates the Catastrophizing and Demanding Bias psychological biases, as the person is exaggerating the potential problems and has unrealistic expectations for themselves. However, it does not show the IKEA Effect, which is a bias that leads people to overvalue items they have invested time and effort into creating or assembling."
