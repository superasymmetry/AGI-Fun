Let me start by recalling the haiku structure: 5-7-5 syllables.\n\nFirst line needs 5 syllables. Maybe start with an image related to love. \"Your breath on my neck\"\u2014that's 5 syllables. Sets an intimate scene.\n\nSecond line is 7 syllables. Include \"wonder\". How about \"a wonder that blooms without sound\"? Combines nature imagery with the theme, and \"wonder\" fits naturally.\n\nThird line back to 5 syllables. Needs to conclude the emotion. \"Spring\u2019s first secret found.\" References spring, symbolizing new love, and ties back to the secret or discovery aspect. That's 5 syllables.\n\nCheck the flow: Intimate moment, the feeling of wonder, and the revelation of love. First-person perspective is there with \"my\". All requirements met. Let me make sure the syllables are right. Your breath on my neck (5), a wonder that blooms without sound (7), Spring\u2019s first secret found (5). Yep, that works. Should I adjust any words for better imagery? \"Blooms without sound\" captures quiet growth of love. \"Secret found\" implies discovery. It all ties together. I think this should work.\n</think>\n\n**Haiku**  \nYour breath on my neck\u2014  \na wonder that blooms without sound.  \nSpring\u2019s first secret found.  \n\n*The haiku uses first-person intimacy (\"your breath on my neck\") to evoke love, ties \"wonder\" to quiet, organic growth (\"blooms without sound\"), and closes with a metaphor of discovery (\"Spring\u2019s first secret\") to merge natural imagery with emotional revelation.*"
