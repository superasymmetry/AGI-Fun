I would stand there, hopeful, thinking I could keep that light alive, that its brilliance would never fade. But, over time, it grew weaker, and no matter how hard I tried to reignite its glow, the encroaching darkness was inevitable. Now, in the silence left behind, I find myself wandering through the shadows, searching for even the slightest glimmer to guide me through the emptiness."
