Let's construct a 3x3 payoff matrix where Player 1 has a weakly dominant strategy.\n\nBased on the requirement, let's construct the matrix where Player 1's weakly dominant strategy corresponds to the given payoffs [8, 2, 6] for one of their action rows. \n\nTo ensure it is weakly dominant, we make sure that in each column, the payoff for Player 1 in this row is at least as high as the payoffs in the Player 1 portions of the other rows. \n\nFor Player 2, we arrange payoffs such that no row strictly dominates another row.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (8,4), (2,3), (6,5) ],\n [ (3,4), (1,3), (0,5) ],\n [ (2,2), (2,2), (3,3) ]]\n",
