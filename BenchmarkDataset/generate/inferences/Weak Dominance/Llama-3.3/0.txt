    "inferences": "To generate an example of weak dominance in game theory where there is a weakly dominant strategy for only one player, let's consider a simple 3x3 payoff matrix. The weakly dominant strategy for Player 1 should yield payoffs of [5, 3, 0] when the other player takes the corresponding actions.\n\nLet's denote the strategies for Player 1 as rows (R1, R2, R3) and for Player 2 as columns (C1, C2, C3). We want one of the rows to be weakly dominant for Player 1, meaning that for any given column, the payoff in the weakly dominant row is at least as good as the payoff in any other row.\n\nFor simplicity, let's make R1 the weakly dominant strategy for Player 1, with payoffs [5, 3, 0] for columns C1, C2, and C3 respectively. To ensure R1 is weakly dominant, we need to make sure that for each column, the payoff in R1 is greater than or equal to the payoffs in R2 and R3.\n\nHere's an example payoff matrix that meets these conditions:\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (5,1), (3,2), (0,3) ],\n[ (4,1), (2,4), (1,2) ],\n[ (4,1), (2,2), (1,1) ]]",
