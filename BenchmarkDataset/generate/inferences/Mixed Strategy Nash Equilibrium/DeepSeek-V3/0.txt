The matrix must be a valid representation of a game in game theory.                             It must be in the following format:\n\n[[ (A1,B1), (A2,B2) ],\n [ (A3,B3), (A4,B4) ]]\n\nWhere Ai and Bi represent the non-negative,                             integer-valued payoffs for Player 1 and Player 2 respectively. Include no text other than the payoff matrix."
