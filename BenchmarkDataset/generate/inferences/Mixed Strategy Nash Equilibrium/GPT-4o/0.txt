    "inferences": "To construct a payoff matrix where Player 1 has a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium involving two actions, we need to ensure that the expected payoffs for both actions, when mixed, make Player 1 indifferent. Similarly, Player 2 must have a corresponding mixed strategy.\n\nLet's denote Player 1's actions as A1 and A2, and Player 2's actions as B1 and B2. For Player 1 to be indifferent between A1 and A2, the expected payoff of playing A1 must equal the expected payoff of playing A2, given Player 2's strategies.\n\nLet's assume Player 2 takes Action 1 with probability p and Action 2 with probability (1-p).\n\nThe payoffs are set so that Player 1's expected payoff for both actions equals when taking their strategy:\n\n- Expected payoff for Player 1 choosing A1: p * (A1,B1) + (1-p) * (A2,B2)\n- Expected payoff for Player 1 choosing A2: p * (A3,B3) + (1-p) * (A4,B4)\n\nFor Player 1 to be indifferent, these expected payoffs must be equal:\n\np * (A1,B1) + (1-p) * (A2,B2) = p * (A3,B3) + (1-p) * (A4,B4)\n\nSimilarly, Player 2's expected payoffs for choices B1 and B2 should leave them indifferent, ensuring they are also mixing optimally.\n\nLet's design a simple payoff matrix to reflect this condition:\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (2,3), (5,1) ],\n [ (4,2), (1,4) ]]\n<OUTPUT>",
