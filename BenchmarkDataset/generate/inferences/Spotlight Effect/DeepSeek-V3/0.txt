    "inferences": "Certainly! Here's an example that demonstrates **Black-and-White Thinking** and **Demanding Bias** without involving the **Sunk Cost Fallacy**:\n\n---\n\n### **Scenario: Workplace Performance Review**  \n**Employee (Alex):**  \n*\"If I don\u2019t get a perfect score on my performance review, then I\u2019m a complete failure as an employee. My manager must recognize my efforts with the highest rating\u2014anything less is unacceptable.\"*  \n\n#### **Biases Demonstrated:**  \n1. **Black-and-White Thinking (All-or-Nothing Thinking):**  \n   - Alex views performance in extreme terms: either \"perfect\" or a \"complete failure,\" with no middle ground.  \n\n2. **Demanding Bias (Rigid \"Must\" Statements):**  \n   - Alex insists that the manager *must* give the highest rating, framing it as an absolute requirement rather than a preference.  \n\n#### **Why Sunk Cost Fallacy is Absent:**  \n- There\u2019s no mention of Alex persisting with a failing strategy or sticking with a past investment (time, effort, etc.) despite poor outcomes. The example focuses on rigid thinking and unrealistic demands, not past costs influencing decisions.  \n\n---\n\nThis example cleanly isolates the two biases while avoiding any overlap with the Sunk Cost Fallacy. Let me know if you'd like refinements!"
