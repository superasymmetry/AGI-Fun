We will also ensure that the strategies in this column are best responses, forming a Nash equilibrium. \n\nWe have to create a matrix where the column with the Nash equilibrium for Player 2 ensures Player 2 gets the payoffs [7, 3, 5] for each corresponding row:\n\n1. The first row (say for Player 1 taking action 1) results in Player 2 getting a payoff of 7.\n2. The second row (for Player 1 taking action 2) results in Player 2 getting a payoff of 3.\n3. The third row (for Player 1 taking action 3) results in Player 2 getting a payoff of 5.\n\nWe must also ensure that those responses are indeed the best for Player 2 given Player 1's actions, and Player 1 has no incentive to deviate from their current strategy if Player 2 plays these actions.\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (3,7), (1,1), (4,0) ],\n [ (2,1), (2,3), (3,2) ],\n [ (5,5), (2,2), (1,5) ]]\n",
