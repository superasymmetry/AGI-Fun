In a PNE, each player's strategy should be the best response to the other player's strategy\n2. The payoffs [8,5,7] for Player 2 must appear in one row\n3. We need to ensure that when we place the PNE, it's genuinely a stable point\n\nLet's construct the matrix such that the PNE occurs where Player 2 can get 8 payoff, as this is the highest value in the given sequence [8,5,7].\n\n<OUTPUT>\n[[ (3,4), (2,3), (4,2) ],\n [ (5,8), (3,5), (4,7) ],\n [ (2,6), (1,4), (3,5) ]]",
