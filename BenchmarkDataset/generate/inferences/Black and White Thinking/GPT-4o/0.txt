    "prompt": "Generate an example that demonstrates the Spotlight Effect and Fundamental Attribution Error psychological biases, but that does not show the IKEA Effect psychological bias.",
    "inferences": "Sure! Here's an example that illustrates the Spotlight Effect and the Fundamental Attribution Error, without involving the IKEA Effect:\n\n**Scenario:**\n\nEmily is at her company's annual gala, where she has the opportunity to network with colleagues and industry leaders. She recently got a new haircut and is quite self-conscious about it. As she walks into the venue, she feels like everyone is staring at her new hairstyle and judging it. This is an example of the **Spotlight Effect**, where Emily overestimates how much others are paying attention to her appearance.\n\nDuring the event, Emily notices a colleague, Jake, who spills his drink on his shirt while talking to some senior managers. She immediately thinks to herself, \"Jake is so clumsy and unprofessional.\" This demonstrates the **Fundamental Attribution Error**, where Emily attributes Jake's mishap to his personal characteristics rather than considering situational factors, such as nerves during an important social event.\n\nIn this scenario, the **IKEA Effect** is not demonstrated because there is no indication that Emily or Jake is valuing their own efforts or creations disproportionately highly. The focus is solely on their perceptions and attributions concerning social and personal cues, without any specific context involving self-created products or tasks."
