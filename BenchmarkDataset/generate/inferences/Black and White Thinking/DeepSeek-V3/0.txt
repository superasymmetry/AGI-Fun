    "inferences": "Certainly! Here's an example that demonstrates **Catastrophizing** and **Black-and-White Thinking** without invoking the **Endowment Effect**:\n\n---\n\n### **Scenario: Job Interview Feedback**  \n*Alex applies for a competitive job but receives a rejection email. Their thought process includes the following biases:*\n\n1. **Black-and-White Thinking (All-or-Nothing):**  \n   *\"I didn\u2019t get this job, so I\u2019ll never succeed in my career. I\u2019m a total failure.\"*  \n   - Alex frames the situation in extremes\u2014either total success or complete failure\u2014ignoring the possibility of partial progress or future opportunities.\n\n2. **Catastrophizing:**  \n   *\"This rejection means no company will ever hire me. I\u2019ll end up unemployed forever and lose everything!\"*  \n   - Alex spirals into imagining the worst possible outcome, assuming a single setback guarantees lifelong ruin.\n\n---\n\n### **Why This Avoids the Endowment Effect:**  \nThe **Endowment Effect** involves overvaluing something simply because you own it (e.g., thinking your old car is worth more than market value). This scenario doesn\u2019t involve ownership or attachment to an object/idea\u2014just distorted thinking about future outcomes.  \n\n**Key Difference:**  \n- Catastrophizing/Black-and-White Thinking = Cognitive distortions about events.  \n- Endowment Effect = Irrational attachment to owned items.  \n\nThis example keeps the focus on exaggerated negative predictions and rigid dichotomies."
