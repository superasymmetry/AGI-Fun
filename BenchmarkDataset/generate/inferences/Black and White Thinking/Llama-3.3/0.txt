    "inferences": "Here's an example that demonstrates the Demanding Bias and Pseudocertainty Effect psychological biases:\n\nImagine a tech startup, GreenEarth, that specializes in developing sustainable energy solutions. The company's CEO, Alex, is considering two investment options to expand their operations:\n\nOption A: Invest $1 million in a new solar panel manufacturing facility, which is expected to generate a 10% return on investment (ROI) with a 90% certainty.\n\nOption B: Invest $1 million in a cutting-edge, experimental wind turbine technology, which is expected to generate a 20% ROI but with only a 60% certainty.\n\nWhen presenting the options to the board of directors, Alex emphasizes the potential benefits of Option B, highlighting its higher potential ROI and downplaying the risks associated with its lower certainty. Alex demands that the board consider only the most optimistic scenarios for Option B, ignoring the possibility of failure.\n\nThe board, influenced by Alex's demands and the promise of higher returns, begins to exhibit the Demanding Bias. They start to demand more and more information to support the decision to invest in Option B, seeking reassurance that the higher ROI is achievable. At the same time, they become overconfident in their ability to predict the outcome of the investment, exhibiting the Pseudocertainty Effect. They start to believe that the 60% certainty is actually much higher, and that the investment is almost guaranteed to succeed.\n\nIn this example, the Demanding Bias is demonstrated by the board's increasing demands for information to support the decision, while the Pseudocertainty Effect is shown by their overconfidence in the certainty of the investment's success. This example does not demonstrate the Normalcy Bias, as the board is not underestimating the likelihood of a disaster or unexpected event (in this case, the failure of the investment). Instead, they are overestimating the certainty of success."
