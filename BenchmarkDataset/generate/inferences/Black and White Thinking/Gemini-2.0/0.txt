    "inferences": "Okay, here's an example designed to showcase the Spotlight Effect and Demanding Bias, while specifically avoiding the Fundamental Attribution Error:\n\n**Scenario:**\n\nImagine you are a new employee at a company that values creativity. You've only been there a week. Your team is brainstorming ideas for a new ad campaign targeting young adults.  You're nervous because you're new, and everyone else seems confident and established.\n\nDuring the brainstorming session, you blurt out a somewhat silly, off-the-wall idea: \"What if we had a giant inflatable avocado that follows people around all day?\"\n\nEveryone pauses, stares at you for a moment, and then the brainstorming continues, seemingly unaffected.  Nobody comments on your idea, positive or negative, but you *feel* like everyone thinks your idea is ridiculous.\n\n**Here's how the biases are demonstrated:**\n\n*   **Spotlight Effect:** You *believe* that everyone is hyper-focused on your \"bad\" idea. You feel like all eyes are on you and everyone is judging your contribution. You're convinced they're thinking about how dumb your avocado idea was, and that it has forever colored their perception of you. You think everyone noticed your awkward delivery, and your red face, and the slight stammer you had. You imagine they're all discussing your failure later.\n\n    In reality, while people may have briefly registered your idea, they probably quickly moved on and focused on their own thoughts and contributions. They may have even forgotten about it completely within minutes. The attention you perceive is far greater than the actual attention you received.\n\n*   **Demanding Bias:** Because you are new to the company, you feel very pressured to do well and immediately fit in. You may think that you need to come up with a winning idea to quickly prove your worth to your new team. You have an internal \"demand\" on yourself to come up with a great idea, and therefore may overestimate the importance of your contributions.\n\n**Why this *doesn't* show the Fundamental Attribution Error:**\n\nThe Fundamental Attribution Error involves attributing *other people's* behavior to their personality or character, rather than considering situational factors. This example focuses solely on *your* perceptions of *your* own behavior and how you believe others are reacting. It doesn't involve judging the *causes* of *anyone else's* actions.\n\n**To make it clearer, let's say someone *did* judge you (but it's not part of the core example):**\n\nIf someone *did* say, \"That's the stupidest idea I've ever heard. You're clearly not cut out for this job,\" *that* would be closer to Fundamental Attribution Error. But even then, it might not be a full example because it could be situational, if the whole purpose of the brainstorming was to come up with serious, practical ideas, and that was made clear, then that idea might not be a good fit.\n\n**In summary:** The example focuses on *your* internal feelings of being in the spotlight and feeling the pressure to perform. It doesn't involve attributing the actions of others to their disposition or character. By not making assumptions about why other people did or did not respond, this example avoids the Fundamental Attribution Error while clearly illustrating the Spotlight Effect and Demanding Bias.\n"
